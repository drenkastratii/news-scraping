1,BBC,Trump says he 'didn't see' part of video with racist clip depicting Obamas as apes,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8r8y78g10o,"US President Donald Trump has said he ""didn't see"" the part of a social media video which showed a racist clip depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The clip - set to the song The Lion Sleeps Tonight - was at the end of a 62-second video he shared containing claims about voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The video was later removed. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Trump said ""I didn't make a mistake"" when asked whether he was going to apologise. He added he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted by a staff member and didn't know it contained that depiction of the Obamas. Republican Senator Tim Scott - who is black - described it as ""the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House"". The White House initially defended the clip as an ""internet meme video"" and told critics to ""stop the fake outrage"". But after fierce backlash, including from several Republican senators, the post was removed from Trump's Truth Social account and a White House official said that a staffer had ""erroneously"" made the post. The clip - which recalls racist caricatures comparing black people to monkeys - appears to be taken from an X post shared by conservative meme creator Xerias in October. That video also depicts several other high-profile Democrats as animals, including New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Trump's predecessor in the White House, Joe Biden, is also depicted as an ape eating a banana. The Obamas have yet to comment on the video. The video was one of dozens posted to Trump's Truth Social account overnight. ""I look at a lot of thousands of things,"" the president said while aboard Air Force One on Friday, adding that after watching only part of the video he ""gave it to the people who generally, they look at the whole thing"". He says he liked the video's message on voter fraud, but that if his staff had looked at the whole thing, ""probably they would have had the sense to take it down"". ""We took it down as soon as we found out about it,"" he added. Some criticism came from within Trump's own party. Senator Scott, a South Carolina Republican and an ally of Trump, posted that he was ""praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House"". ""The President should remove it,"" he added. Another Republican, New York representative Mike Lawler, called the post ""wrong and incredibly offensive - whether intentional or a mistake"" and said it ""should be deleted immediately with an apology offered."" The criticism continued even after the post was taken down. John Curtis, a Republican Senator from Utah, posted on social media that the video was ""blatantly racist and inexcusable"". ""It should never have been posted or left published for so long,"" he wrote. According to CBS, the BBC's US partner, Florida representative Byron Donalds - a longtime supporter of Trump's who is running for governor - called the White House after the video was posted and was told that it was the work of a staffer who ""let the president down"". The BBC has contacted the White House for clarification on how many people have access to the president's account and what the approval process is for posts. In a statement sent to the BBC earlier in the day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that the clip is from ""an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King"". ""Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public,"" she added. Before it was removed, Derrick Johnson, the president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP, called the video ""disgusting and utterly despicable"" and accused Trump of attempting to distract the public from the Epstein case and a ""rapidly failing economy."" Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications in the Obama White House, said: ""Let it haunt Trump and his racist followers that future Americans will embrace the Obamas as beloved figures while studying him as a stain on our country."" In a short post of his own, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said that ""Donald Trump is a racist"". ""Disgusting behaviour by the president,"" the office of California Governor Gavin Newsom wrote on X. ""Every single Republican must denounce this. Now."" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries - who himself accused Trump of racism last year after he shared an AI-image depicting Jeffries with a moustache and sombrero - responded to the recent video by calling Trump a ""vile, unhinged and malignant bottom feeder"". ""Every single Republican must immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry,"" he added. The clip of the Obamas was added to the end of a minute-long video which included claims about a voting conspiracy in Michigan in the 2020 presidential election. Those claims were debunked as part of Dominion Voting System's successful civil legal actions against some media companies. Trump also has a long history of criticising and attacking Obama. Before his first term as president, Trump regularly made false claims that the Hawaii-born Obama was actually born in Kenya and therefore was ineligible to be president. He later acknowledged that Obama was born in the US. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Nearly 200 decaying bodies were discovered at the Return to Nature home after officials investigated a foul smell. Some desperate Iranians want US intervention, but others worry that it would not achieve the peace protesters ultimately want."
2,BBC,Trump threatens tariffs for countries trading with Iran,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4glgz2l83vo,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order threatening to impose additional tariffs on countries that continue to trade with Iran. The order, issued on Friday, does not specify the rate that could be imposed, but uses 25% as an example. It says the tariff could apply to goods imported into the US from any nation that ""directly or indirectly purchases, imports, or otherwise acquires any goods or services from Iran"". Trump has not directly commented on the order but reiterated ""no nuclear weapons"" for Iran when speaking from Air Force One on Friday night. It comes as talks continue between senior US and Iranian officials in Oman, following several weeks of threats from both sides. Trump threatened a 25% tariff of countries doing business with Iran earlier this year, in a post to Truth Social. On 12 January, he wrote: ""Effective immediately, any country doing business with the Islamic Republic of Iran will pay a tariff of 25% on any and all business being done with the United States of America."" At the time, no further detail was provided on how the tariffs would work in practice. The White House said that this latest executive order reaffirmed the ""ongoing national emergency with respect to Iran"" and noted that the president may modify it of circumstances change. It read: ""The President is holding Iran accountable for its pursuit of nuclear capabilities, support for terrorism, ballistic missile development, and regional destabilisation that endanger American security, allies, and interests."" Separately, the US state department announced on Friday that it was sanctioning 15 entities ""that have traded in Iranian-origin crude oil, petroleum products, or petrochemical products"". There was no immediate comment to either announcement from Iran, which is already subject to extensive sanctions imposed by the US and other Western powers over the country's nuclear programme. Tehran insists this is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Under a 2015 nuclear deal with world leaders, Iran was not permitted to enrich uranium above 3.67% purity - the level required for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants - and was not allowed to carry out any enrichment at its Fordo plant for 15 years. However, Trump abandoned the agreement during his first term in 2018, saying it did too little to stop a pathway to a bomb, and reinstated US sanctions, which crippled the Iranian economy. Those measures - affecting oil exports, shipping and banks - included ""secondary sanctions"" on countries trading with Iran. Tehran retaliated by increasingly breaching restrictions under the deal, particularly those related to the production of enriched uranium. Last year, the UN reimposed economic and military sanctions after the UK, France and Germany accused the country of ""continued nuclear escalation"" and lack of co-operation. Despite sanctions on certain products and industries, there are still more than 100 countries that trade with Iran. Its biggest export partner is China. In the year to October 2025, Beijing bought more than $14bn (£10.4bn) of products from Iran, according to figures from Trade Data Monitor based on official Iranian data. China is followed by Iraq, which received $10.5bn worth of goods from its neighbour. Iran also counts the United Arab Emirates and Turkey among its largest customers. Exports from Iran to Turkey jumped substantially from $4.7bn in 2024 to $7.3bn last year. Starting in Oman on Friday, the ongoing talks are the first involving US and Iranian officials since last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities. The Iranian delegation was led by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, while the US was represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Speaking to reporters onboard Air Force One, Trump said Friday's talks were ""very good"", and that Iran ""looks like it wants to make a deal very badly"". ""If they don't make a deal, the consequences are very steep,"" the president said, adding that there will be another meeting early next week. Oman's Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi, who mediated the discussions, said they had been ""useful to clarify both Iranian and American thinking and identify areas for possible progress"". In a statement to X, Araghchi described the talks to date as ""a good start"" and said that a ""positive atmosphere prevailed"". He said negotiators had now returned to their respective capitals for consultation. Rising tensions between the US and Iran have raised fears of a conflict between the countries, with Trump declaring that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be ""very worried"" as recently as Wednesday. The president has said he would be prepared to strike the Middle Eastern nation if it refused to reach a deal on its nuclear programme. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and has repeatedly denied accusations by the US and its allies that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The US has also built up a significant military presence in the region, including what Trump describes as a ""massive armada"" in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month. Human rights groups have said that many thousands of people were killed in the crackdown, but the full scale of the bloodshed remains unclear due to internet restrictions imposed by the government since 8 January. It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Nearly 200 decaying bodies were discovered at the Return to Nature home after officials investigated a foul smell.

However, I'm a bit confused about the rules regarding the hammer. If one of the commentators could explain that in more detail, that would be great John in Warrington John, we're here to help! The hammer refers to the advantage gained by delivering the last stone in an end and it enables the team to create the best strategy with the final stone to gain more points. Before each match, two players from each team deliver two stones to the target and whoever has the shortest average distance to the centre of the target win the hammer in the first end. It is then alternated until the end of the match. The one caveat to that is that, if you don't score when you've got the hammer, you hold on to it for the next end.

Curling mixed doubles - GB v Canada Team GB are under way in the mixed doubles curling against Canada. They are leading 5-1 and have just started the fourth end. Katie FalkinghamBBC Sport in Livigno Competing against Kirsty Muir in the women's freeski slopestyle is Eileen Gu, a triple medallist from the Beijing Olympics four years ago. Gu is American-born but represents China, and is one of the highest-paid female athletes in the world. In 2025, she ranked fourth in the Forbes list having earned $23.1m (Â£16.9m), putting her behind tennis stars Coco Gauff, Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek. But unlike those three, very little of Gu's income is earned directly from her sport. Instead, it comes through big endorsements with the likes of Red Bull and Porsche. She's also modelled for Victoriaâs Secret in New York and Louis Vuitton in Paris, all while a student at Stanford University. So despite all that, why is she back at the Olympics? Easy. âIâm doing this because Iâve seen the world and the best that it has to offer, and I think that this is the best thing in the world,"" she told Time magazine, external. Women's freeski slopestyle qualifying Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, aged just 17. She's back four years later to try and better her fifth-place finish in the the big air competition and eighth in the slope-style. Muir has had her struggles since - including recovering from a torn ACL - but the 21-year-old Scot arrives in Italy on the back of winning X Games slopestyle gold in January.

4,BBC,Their parents are in disgrace - what now for Beatrice and Eugenie?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8r5pjlgv7o,"After a bruising week, it's hard to overstate the mess that Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and Sarah Ferguson find themselves in. But increasingly it appears it's a mess their daughters also can't escape. The newly released emails indicate that Jeffrey Epstein had a bigger presence than previously thought in the lives of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. One exchange suggests they had lunch with him in Miami, just days after his release from prison for prostituting minors. Elsewhere, it appears they were called upon by him to entertain his contacts and give tours of Buckingham Palace. For Beatrice, now 37, and Eugenie, 35, these new revelations could put their future under scrutiny. ""It will raise questions from the public about just what they were doing,"" says royal commentator Richard Palmer. But royal journalist Victoria Murphy says while the emails make for ""really, really uncomfortable reading"", there continues to be sympathy towards the princesses. And there's no doubt that seeing a picture apparently of your father on all fours, crouching over a young woman, can only be deeply embarrassing. It should be said Andrew has always denied any wrongdoing, and being named among the Epstein files is not an indication of wrongdoing. So after the York family brand has been dragged through the mud, where do the princesses now fit within the Royal Family? Both princesses are repeatedly mentioned in the latest dump of Epstein files. Media reports of the alleged lunch in Miami have often referred to ""the girls"", suggesting they were younger than they were. At the time of that visit Eugenie was 19 and Beatrice was 21. ""They weren't five-year-old girls when they were taken to see Epstein. They were grown ups,"" argues author Andrew Lownie, who wrote the book Entitled about Andrew. ""There's a big campaign to say they are innocents caught up in the shellfire, but they're not, they're deeply involved."" But Murphy disagrees with that portrayal, arguing it's understandable to see why they went along with it. ""It's easy to be critical of that decision now that Epstein's crimes are front and centre, but if no-one was raising any flags for them at the time you can see how they would just have gone on the trip their mother organised."" The perks of being friends with Jeffrey Epstein are also apparent. An exchange between Epstein and his assistant seems to suggest he paid for the family's flights, totalling ""for all tickets: $14,080.10"". But it was not all one way. On several occasions Epstein appears to ask Ferguson if her daughters can meet people, and on one appears to ask for them to show the redacted person Buckingham Palace. Once, Ferguson apologises, saying they were not around and explaining their whereabouts. In another extraordinary exchange, a ""Sarah"" appears to refer to Eugenie's love life - saying she is returning from a ""shagging weekend"". In some of the emails, Epstein's contacts also refer to the princesses. One email, sent to Epstein from a friend, reads: ""Just spoke to Duchess of Pork. She is at this wild lunch with Beatrice. I just introduced myself to her. Told her 1 know (barely) her father and how terrific he is...more later."" Ferguson's representatives have been asked for comment. But for Palmer, the repeated mentions of both princesses in the emails ""makes it difficult to distance themselves"" from the saga. ""There's no avoiding the links between the Yorks and Epstein,"" he says. Neither of the sisters are working royals. Both are married with children, and have their own careers. But like other royals both princesses also have philanthropic endeavours. Eugenie co-founded the Anti-Slavery Collective, a charity whose focus includes victims of sex trafficking. ""It's a preposterously inappropriate cause for [Eugenie] to be involved with,"" said Lownie. According to the most recently available accounts, donations have slumped - from £1.5m in 2024 to £48,000 in the year ending 2025, although it has a healthy sum of money in reserves. No income was raised from events or auctions in the year to 2025, compared with the previous financial year when a major gala fundraiser was held. The charity has said that it hopes to hold a similar gala every three years. But a source from the sector has said it is ""difficult optically to do anything high profile like that again"". ""Unsurprisingly, it's keeping a low profile,"" they added. BBC News has approached the Anti-Slavery Collective multiple times to ask for a comment in light of the latest controversy surrounding Andrew and Epstein, but it has not responded. We also approached a number of other charities the princesses are involved with, asking whether they retain their confidence in light of the recent emails. Outward Bound said Princess Beatrice is involved with the group ""in her honorary role as Deputy Patron"". But Salvation Army, which has a long-standing partnership with Eugenie, struck a more cautious note. ""We place victims and survivors at the heart of all our decision making and we are closely monitoring this story,"" a spokesperson said. Away from their charity work, the princesses both also have jobs. Beatrice founded advisory firm BY-EQ, while Eugenie works as a director at the art gallery Hauser & Wirth in Mayfair. It has recently faced legal challenges regarding alleged breaches of Russian sanctions, though it strongly contests these accusations. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Eugenie. Southwark Crown Court told BBC News the trial date had been set for 2028. Last year, around the time her father lost his prince title, Beatrice was pictured at an investment summit in Saudi Arabia. Her family have long-held links to the Middle East and she also recently appeared in a promotional picture for a UAE bank. Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi have also been involved in some of her father's business activities. They were present at Pitch@Palace, Andrew's start up business network, and were pictured meeting the then-Chinese ambassador to the UK in 2020, alongside her parents. Palmer suggests there may have been a blurring of royal role and personal profit. The princess, he said, built her career off the back of her royal status and introductions her parents gave her, ""meeting all sorts of business contacts and members of royal families abroad"". Both princesses have independently wealthy husbands, and two children each. Beatrice's husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi is a property developer, descended from Italian nobility, while Eugenie's, Jack Brooksbank, has worked in hospitality and marketing. Beatrice splits her time between her Cotswolds property and an apartment in St James' Palace. Eugenie lives between Portugal and Ivy Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace. It is understood the princesses do pay rent on their royal properties. But the Palace would not confirm if it is paid at a market rate. It comes at a time of mounting calls for wider transparency about royal finances, following the outcry over Andrew's lease agreement at his former Windsor mansion. This week, Andrew moved to the King's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, which means he is no longer close to his daughters and grandchildren. At present Ferguson's whereabouts are unknown, although there has been speculation she may move to Portugal to live with her younger daughter. Privately, the princesses remain in touch with their parents, says Palmer. ""From what I understand, they are still speaking to them,"" he says, ""and want to remain loyal to them."" But in public, he says, they will keep their distance. ""They need to separate themselves publicly from their parents otherwise risk the toxicity spreading further to them."" When Andrew lost his titles, Beatrice and Eugenie kept theirs. There is also no change to the line of succession. But some have questioned where they now fit within the wider Royal Family. The sisters have always been said to be close to the Prince of Wales and Duke of Sussex and have shared what it is like to grow up in the limelight. Eugenie is reported to have been particularly close to Harry, and travelled to California to visit him. Footage in the Harry and Meghan documentary showed her attending the Super Bowl, going on bike rides with her cousin and playing with his son Archie on a beach. Like Harry, both Beatrice and Eugenie have now found themselves on the outskirts of the family. But even in recent years, with their father's disgrace hanging over them, they have continued to attend, and be part of, royal occasions. The biggest question mark for many, was where they would spend this past Christmas. Until the last minute, it was unclear whether the princesses would appear at Sandringham. But in the end, they did - choosing to spend Christmas Day with the wider Royal Family, rather than with their parents in disgrace at Royal Lodge. For Lownie, it's a clear sign that a deal was struck between Andrew and the King - that he and Ferguson would ""go quietly"", so long as their daughters were protected. But what's also clear is that they wouldn't have been there if King Charles had not wanted them there. Their appearance gives us an insight into how the Palace is seeing things: Beatrice and Eugenie are still members of the Royal Family. They are still in the firm, and will be looked after. As the Royal Family walked the short distance from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church for the Christmas Day service, both Beatrice and Eugenie, alongside their husbands, were prominent among the group, just behind the King and Queen. It is, perhaps, a sign of how they intend to move forward amid the Epstein fallout. Until now, the princesses have always been seen as part of a package, together with Andrew and Ferguson as part of the House of York. Whatever happens next, Beatrice and Eugenie will need to step out from their shadow if they are to continue to be an active part of the Royal Family. Former Labour Party peer tells sex offender he found ""a great place to stay"" with ""privacy"", a document suggests. Millions of Epstein-related documents released by the US justice department include the names of the world's rich and powerful. Millions of files released this week shed fresh light on the links between Jeffrey Epstein and prominent political and public figures. Mette-Marit says she is sorry to Norwegians for not realising what kind of person the late sex offender was. No 10 says it's the ""early stages"" of gathering documents related to the peer's appointment as US ambassador."
5,BBC,They were drawn to Korea with dreams of K-pop stardom - but then let down,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgnq9rwyqno,"As K-pop's popularity soars, South Korea has become a destination for young people around the world hoping to break into the industry. And many take that chance each year to enroll in programmes promising a path to stardom. That hope brought Miyu to South Korea in 2024. Her name has been changed to protect her identity. Armed with big dreams, the teen paid 3m yen ($19,800; £14,500) to join a six-month programme at a K-pop training academy in Seoul. In return, she was to be given professional dance and vocal lessons and the opportunity to audition for major music agencies. ""There were supposed to be weekly auditions, but that never happened,"" Miyu told the BBC on a street in Hongdae, a neighbourhood in Seoul known for its music scene. Lessons were few and far between, she said, and she also alleged she was sexually harassed by a senior staff member. The company, which we have not named for legal reasons, has denied all allegations. Miyu's allegations - and those of others at the academy - shed light on an under-regulated industry where the promise of opportunity often comes with risk. The BBC spoke to two other trainees who attended the same academy. One of them also alleged sexual harassment by the same staff member, while the third said she had witnessed inappropriate behaviour towards others, but she hadn't experienced it herself. All of them said the programme had promised audition opportunities, which did not happen. The company denied this, saying there were opportunities to audition, and added that nearly 200 foreign trainees had participated in its programmes since it opened in the late 2010s. K-pop training institutes are usually classified either as Hagwon, or private academies, which are regulated by the education department, or as entertainment agencies. The company Miyu attended is registered as the latter, putting it outside South Korea's education laws. Instead, it is one of some 5,800 agencies overseen by the Ministry of Culture, whose regulatory powers are far more limited. Their training programmes are not subject to regulation or inspection, a local official told the BBC. An official from the Ministry of Education told the BBC that current regulations did not restrict travel and entertainment agencies from teaching language and dance to foreign nationals, so it was difficult to regulate such ""academy-type agencies"". ""I dreamed of becoming an idol - but what I went through felt more like a scam,""  Miyu, who is still a teen, said. ""[This is] where I pursued my dream, but it also brings back my trauma."" Miyu was drawn to K-pop in middle school. It was Lisa - the Thai rapper-singer who arrived in Korea as a teen and shot to global fame with the K-pop girl group Blackpink - who inspired her journey. Lisa is far from an anomaly in K-pop today. Twice has three Japanese members and one Taiwanese member, and NewJeans has a Vietnamese-Australian singer. Hearts2Heart, which debuted last year, includes the country's first Indonesian idol. But making it to the top, like they have, is tough in what has become a cutthroat K-pop industry. A handful of powerful agencies run the show, which means they have to bet on an aspiring star for them to succeed in Korea. Hybe, South Korea's largest entertainment company and the label behind big names like BTS, does not disclose how many trainees it has on board at any given point. The industry average is estimated to be around 20. But Hybe did tell the Korea Herald newspaper in 2023 that nearly one in three of its trainees are foreign nationals. SM Entertainment, another industry giant, has a dedicated academy for aspiring K-pop performers, and says the majority of its students come from overseas, but did not provide exact figures. But the number of trainees enrolling is shrinking, according to an industry report published in January. In 2024, agencies reported 963 trainees, about half of the number they had signed on in 2020: 1,895. Although the number of foreign trainees reported by agencies doubled to 42 between 2022 and 2024, they are still a fraction of the total figure. It's a highly competitive selection process, and firms weigh up costs to make the decision. Typically it takes about two years for a trainee to debut, and even then only 60% of them make it, according to the report. For foreign trainees, the barriers are even higher - language, visa restrictions and industry connections, all of which possibly worsen already slim odds. And yet the allure of fame draws so many like Miyu to take their shot. Miyu and the other two trainees the BBC spoke to said their academy catered almost exclusively to foreign students and that there were no Korean students enrolled. It's hard to know how many foreigners travel to South Korea to enrol in these training programmes because they can do this on a tourist visa that allows them to stay up to three months at a time. Soon after she got there, Miyu claimed, reality collided with what she was promised. She said the standard of the dance and voice training was not what she expected, given the cost of the programme. She said a senior staff member also began constantly monitoring her whereabouts. After about three months into the programme, he took her out, she claimed. ""He took me to a convenience store alone saying he would buy me ice cream. While I was choosing, he put his hand on my waist and said, 'good body"". He called her on several occasions, according to Miyu. Once, he asked her to come to the office, saying they needed to discuss outfits for a photo shoot. ""He told me to sit on his lap to discuss costumes. I managed to sit on the armrest instead. From that day onwards, I get scared just hearing a man's voice."" Another former foreign trainee Elin, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, also accused the same staff member of touching her inappropriately. She said the staff member had called her into a meeting room and asked for them to be left alone. He then touched her waist while telling her the Korean word for ""hip"", saying he was teaching her Korean. ""I was so scared that I texted my friend and asked her to come quickly,"" Elin said. She also alleged that the staff member would come into their dormitory room, an allegation repeated by Miyu and the third trainee the BBC interviewed. ""He would come… sometimes at two or three in the morning, saying he was fixing the lights. This one time he entered my room while I was asleep and just watched me,"" Elin said, adding she had woken up when she sensed someone entering the room. He left the room without doing anything, but she said she ""couldn't sleep properly after that because I was so scared"". When the BBC contacted the company for comment, their legal representative denied the claims, saying: ""Our company strictly prohibits anyone from entering the female trainees' dormitory without being accompanied by a female staff member, as set forth in our internal regulations."" Elin also claimed that CCTV cameras recording both video and audio had been installed throughout the practice rooms and female dormitories - this allegation was also repeated by Miyu. ""The CCTV was live 24/7. They were picking up the audio as well... I didn't sign any consent to being filmed 24/7,"" said Elin, adding that the senior staff member ""would watch us while we were dancing and make comments through the CCTV"". ""At one point, he told the teacher, 'This isn't sexy enough — you need to teach the girls a sexier dance,"" she said. The company, however, denied that the staff member entered the female dormitory, and said the cameras were installed only in common areas, such as entrances and kitchens, for ""safety reasons"", following past incidents involving intruders. ""The installation was announced in advance and intended entirely to safeguard the trainees,"" the legal representative told the BBC in a written response. Elin says she was never told of this. Eventually, Elin dropped out of the programme and left Korea. The three girls told the BBC that they didn't speak up immediately because they were worried that it could harm their chances in the K-pop industry. They said they also felt unable to tell their parents, who had paid large sums for them to train in Korea. And they faced other challenges, including the language barrier and an unfamiliar legal system. Elin eventually went to the police and registered a case against the staff member, accusing him of sexual harassment and trespassing. But the police dropped the case, citing a lack of evidence. The staff member denied all the allegations. Her lawyers told the BBC that she was looking to appeal against the decision. She has also registered a separate case against the company for breach of contract because of the alleged sexual harassment, trespassing in the dorms and CCTV surveillance. Meanwhile, the company has continued recruiting students and still promotes its K-pop training programmes on social media. When Elin saw this, she was furious. ""K-pop has gained worldwide fame — and with that comes responsibility,"" she said. ""At the very least, I hope the children who chase this dream can do so in a safer environment."" Miyu says she still dreams of becoming an idol. ""Whenever things were hard, I held on by listening to K-pop. I still want to become an idol, no matter what."" Black, crispy, often flat and square, dried seaweed is growing in popularity - but also in price. Next month, Netflix will stream the K-Pop superband's first performance since their reunion. Who's performing, who will win, and everything else you need to know about the 2026 Grammy ceremony. Kim Keon Hee was also ordered to return a Graff diamond necklace and pay back 12.85m won in cash. Kim was accused of accepting luxury bags, a diamond necklace and other gifts as bribes."
6,BBC,Colorado funeral home director sentenced to 40 years for corpse abuse,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q4q7w237yo,"The co-owner of a Colorado funeral home where nearly 200 decaying bodies were found has been sentenced to 40 years in prison for corpse abuse. Before Jon Hallford was sentenced, he apologised in court and listened to family members describe having nightmares about their loved ones decomposing in his care. They called him a ""monster"" who should rot in jail. His ex-wife and co-owner Carie Hallford has pleaded guilty to similar charges and is awaiting sentencing. The Return to Nature home, in the town of Penrose, Colorado, had given fake ashes to grieving relatives instead of their loved-ones' remains. Prosecutors said 189 bodies were improperly stored in the building over four years. The courthouse was packed with family members on Friday, who asked the judge to impose the maximum 50-year sentence. ""I'm a daughter whose mother was treated like yesterday's trash and dumped in a site left to rot with hundreds of others,"" Kelly Mackeen told the court. ""I'm heartbroken, and I ask God every day for grace."" The bodies were found in piles inside non-refrigerated areas of the funeral home. Victims included children and foetuses. ""It is my personal belief that every one of us, every human being, is basically good at the core,"" Judge Eric Bentley said. ""But we live in a world that tests that belief every day, and Mr Hallford, your crimes are testing that belief."" Hallford, who had pleaded guilty in the hopes of a reduced sentence, apologised for his actions ahead of sentencing. ""I had so many chances to put a stop to everything and walk away, but I did not,"" he said. ""My mistakes will echo for a generation. Everything I did was wrong."" Prosecutors say the couple was driven by ""greed"", and were earning enough money from the business to properly care for the bodies. Located about 30 miles (48km) south of Colorado Springs, the funeral home specialised in burials where no chemicals, including embalming fluid, were used and where remains were buried in a biodegradable casket. The business came under investigation after reports of a foul odour coming from the property. Officials discovered 115 bodies there early last October. Jon Hallford was accused by officials of attempting to conceal the ""improper storage of human remains"". Green funerals are allowed in the state but remains must be buried within 24 hours or be properly refrigerated. Funeral home operators in Colorado are currently not required to be licensed, have a degree in mortuary science or even graduate high school. Tougher legislation has been passed since the scandal erupted. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Some desperate Iranians want US intervention, but others worry that it would not achieve the peace protesters ultimately want. The US president says he ""didn't make a mistake"", adding he had only seen the beginning of the video before it was posted."
7,BBC,"More than 30 killed in blast at Pakistan mosque, officials say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7y7gz2835o,"At least 31 people have been killed and 169 injured in an explosion at a mosque during Friday prayers in Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, officials say. According to police, a suicide bomber detonated a device after approaching the gates of the Shia mosque in the Tarlai area of the city. Eyewitnesses have told the BBC the blast was preceded by the sound of gunfire. An emergency was declared as hospitals began to receive the wounded, with an appeal sent out for blood donations. Condemning the incident, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed ""deep grief"" as he called for a thorough investigation and the immediate identification of those behind the attack. In separate statements, Pakistan's President Asif Ali Zardari said ""targeting innocent civilians is a crime against humanity"", while Defence Minister Khawaja Asif suggested India and Afghanistan were behind the attack. Asif said in a social media post that it had been ""proven"" the attacker had travelled to and from Afghanistan, and ""collusion between India and Afghanistan is being revealed"". Afghanistan's Taliban government described Khawaja Asif's comments as ""regrettable"", saying the Pakistani minister ""hastily attempted to attribute the incident to Afghanistan without presenting any credible evidence"". Islamic State group later claimed the attack, in a statement that it said included the name and picture of the attacker. The claim could not be independently verified by the BBC. Afghan foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Qahar Balkhi earlier condemned the attack and extended condolences, calling such attacks a ""contradiction to Islamic and humanitarian values"". The Indian foreign ministry also condemned the attack and sent condolences for the loss of life, calling the accusations it may be involved ""baseless"". Talal Chaudhry, Pakistan's minister of state for interior, said the suspect was not an Afghan citizen, according to local media. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he condemned the attack in the ""strongest terms"" and called for those responsible to be ""identified and brought to justice"". Zaheer Abbas was inside the Khadijatul Kubra Mosque praying when he first heard the sound of bullets. ""After that, we bowed and then prostrated, and then there was an explosion,"" he told BBC Urdu. ""After which there were injured people lying everywhere."" Pictures from the mosque in the aftermath show footwear scattered across the floor, shattered glass, and people sat among the wreckage. Abbas, who said he ""lost his senses"" in the moments after the explosion, was eventually pulled out by emergency services and taken to hospital, where he was quickly released. ""Fortunately, I did not suffer much injury,"" he said. According to Pakistan's defence minister, the attacker opened fire and detonated the bomb after being challenged by security guards. The mosque's caretaker Syed Ashfaq - who lives next door - also heard gunfire, and began running towards the mosque to help. ""By the time I reached it there had already been an explosion,"" he told the BBC. ""Bodies were lying everywhere, some were missing arms, some missing legs. We took the most injured in our own vehicle [to hospital]."" Islamabad's deputy commissioner Irfan Memon said on X that the death toll stood at 31, with the injured numbering 169. Pictures from local hospitals show the injured being brought by private vehicles and ambulances, with one photographer for news agency AFP saying they saw dozens of people arriving at hospital. Attacks are relatively rare in the capital, although one in November left 12 dead. Another 27 were injured in the blast, outside a courthouse. The blast on Friday comes after a week of violence which saw 58 civilians killed in coordinated attacks in the province of Balochistan. The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) rebel group said it was behind the attacks. The military - which has been fighting an insurgency in the region for decades - said it had killed more than 200 militants in response. Last year was also Pakistan's deadliest in over a decade as combat-related deaths surged 74%, with militants accounting for more than half the death toll, according to a new report released by an independent think tank. The Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) said violence in Pakistan left 3,413 people dead - up from 1,950 in 2024 - with 2,138 militants killed. IS claimed the attack in the name of its ""Pakistan Province"" branch on Friday, via the group's Telegram channels. IS's Amaq ""news agency"" issued a statement offering additional details. Amaq alleged that the IS attacker arrived at the ""central temple [mosque]"" in Tarlai district in the Shahzad area. Guards at the location then tried to halt the attacker at the external gate, it claimed, but he fired his pistol at them, injuring two, before heading inside. IS  said the alleged attacker was named ""Sayf Allah al-Ansari"". The nom de guerre Ansari is often used to indicate somebody who is a local to the area. Amaq's report also shared a photo showing what it said was the alleged masked attacker. Additional reporting Caroline Davies"
8,BBC,From Hollywood to the homeland: Why African countries are courting black American stars,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86vz6v07d3o,"Although their forefathers were seized from West and Central Africa centuries ago, the bond between African-Americans and their ancestral home has been a lasting one. For instance, Liberia, Africa's oldest republic, was founded by freed black American slaves in 1822. After Ghana became independent in 1957, a wave of black intellectuals and artists moved there from the US. Martin Luther King, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali subsequently paid high-profile visits to Ghana, while Guinea  became home to Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael. This transatlantic connection has ebbed and flowed over time - but in recent years, there has been a real resurgence, helped by the use of DNA tests. A number of black American celebrities have sought the nationality of African countries - singer Ciara has become a citizen of Benin, rapper Ludacris and film star Samuel L Jackson are officially Gabonese, actors Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors are citizens of Guinea and musical icon Stevie Wonder has Ghanaian papers. Just last week, wildly popular content creator IShowSpeed was approved for a Ghanaian passport after stopping in the country on a whirlwind African tour. The celebs have, in most cases, flown out for elaborate citizenship ceremonies and tours of local beauty spots, all of which have been captured for glossy social media content. Posting photos of her citizenship ceremony in Guinea, Meagan Good told her 7.8m Instagram followers last month: ""This is history in motion"". Good, who has featured in films like Think Like A Man and Saw V, and her husband Majors, known for Creed and Marvel flick Ant-Man and the Wasp, became citizens after DNA testing traced their ancestry to Guinea. ""This recognition goes beyond titles, it is a homecoming and a reconnection to our Afrodescendant roots,"" said Good. Messaging from the various African governments has echoed this sentiment. ""In conferring Ghanaian citizenship upon Stevie Wonder,"" former president Nana Akufo-Addo said at Wonder's 2024 ceremony, ""we not only extend our warmest embrace to a beloved son of Africa but also reaffirm our belief in the enduring spirit of pan-Africanism and the global African family"". Ghana has long promoted its pan-African credentials - for a decade anyone whose ancestors came from Africa have been entitled to Ghanaian nationality, a policy that arguably inspired Benin to launch a similar scheme. Ghana also launched the ""year of return"" in 2019, a buzzy initiative encouraging Africans in the diaspora to relocate there. More than 1,000 African-Americans have done so in the past decade, according to Dr Erieka Bennet, ambassador for the Diaspora African Forum, which helps people relocate to Ghana. ""It is not only about romanticism,"" Marie-Roger Biloa, a Cameroonian journalist with a focus on West Africa, tells the BBC. ""It's all very much about how can we tap into the potential they have, the Americans."" Tourism is an obvious motivator. Governments hope that social media posts from the stars will encourage other black Americans, a large group with a growing economic power, to visit and inject money into their countries. Biloa notes that Benin's president, a former business tycoon, is keenly aware that his country's former role as a key departure point for slaves makes it a poignant destination for black Americans. ""President [Patrice] Talon has really started investing in cultural heritage, in a way to engage the African-Americans worldwide. He understood it could be an engine for a new form of tourism and a new branch of economy,"" she says, mentioning The Marina Project, a memorial and tourist complex being built in Ouidah, once one of Benin's main slave ports. Positive publicity from stars like Ciara may also encourage diasporans to invest or buy property in Benin, as they have been doing in Ghana since the year of return. Soft power is also an important factor - by promoting their culture and building a robust network around the world, countries like Benin, Guinea, Gabon and Ghana stand to gain global influence. In this mission, celebrity citizens act as ambassadors, Francis Kpatindé, a Beninois lecturer at France's Sciences Po University, tells the BBC. ""Benin has no diamonds like the Democratic Republic of Congo, no petrol, nothing. We just have cotton, the ports and culture,"" he says. The celebrity ambassadors are ""a way for us to be on the record, to be on-screen. Now it's working. You can go to the social networks. You see Benin everywhere,"" Kpatindé says. Many people from the countries involved recognise the economic and political benefits of giving citizenship to black American celebrities, but others are more critical. There is an underlying feeling that the stars are bypassing what can be, for those born in the countries, a cumbersome and costly process to get passports. Taufic Suleman, a painter and decorator from Ghana, felt ""irritated"" when the foreign minister announced that IShowSpeed, who grew up in the US but has a Ghanaian mother, had been approved for a passport. ""It is really, really, really a bad precedent... why do people, your citizens, have to go through vetting? Sometimes others end up being denied,"" Suleman, aged 32, tells the BBC. ""You just can't hand out a passport to anyone just because the person is a celebrity."" Following the foreign minister's announcement, Patrick Boamah, a member of the Ghanaian parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, told local broadcaster Channel One that the content creator must follow the required legal procedures to get a passport, although the authorities ""may waive certain steps for him"". Sindé Chekete, the head of Benin's tourism authority, told the BBC that ""citizenship processing is not influenced by celebrity status"" and that Ciara ""followed the same standard procedure as any other applicant"". Another criticism of the celebrity citizenship trend is that it will be superficial and fleeting - the stars will collect their certificates, publish a few social media posts, then go quiet. It is not clear whether, in all cases, the celebrities are required to publicise or maintain lasting links to their second homes, but Chekete stressed that Beninois citizenship ""is not a transaction and it does not come with contractual obligations, whether promotional, financial, or otherwise"". Six months after getting her citizenship, Ciara returned to Benin in January to play at the Vodun Days festival. Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have stressed that their connection with Guinea would be ""long-term and evolving"". ""We could absolutely see ourselves having a home here and spending meaningful time in Guinea,"" they told the BBC over email. Yaw Nyame, one of the numerous Ghanaians who welcomed IShowSpeed's naturalisation, says he hopes the content creator uses his passport to set up a base in the country. ""Even if he's not going to come to Ghana all the time, at least him having his presence in Ghana or doing a project in Ghana,"" Nyame says. The doctor says giving IShowSpeed, real name Darren Watkins Jr, a passport is a ""brilliant, strategic move"" as the creator currently has ""all eyes on him"". He has more than 50 million YouTube subscribers, with a recent 20-country tour of Africa contributing to the growth of his platform. It will take time for Ghana, Gabon, Guinea and Benin to gauge whether their strategies have paid off - maybe one or two decades, Kpatindé says. Earlier this week, Benin's government said it would open a government agency specifically dedicated to nationalising ""Afro-descendants"". However, Ghana reached a roadblock in its plans to reconnect with the diaspora,  announcing it was pausing its citizenship applications  as it needed to make the system more accessible and user-friendly. Regardless, Kpatindé believes that by welcoming home some of the diaspora's brightest stars, the African countries are on the right trajectory. People on the continent have long hailed pan-Africanism, ""but now we need action,"" he says. ""We need concrete acts, not to just speak"".

9,BBC,'Tasty beer': The surprising messages Vikings left behind,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260202-the-viking-secrets-revealed-by-swedens-rune-stones,"Runic inscriptions from the Viking Age still turn up in Sweden 1,000 years after they were written – revealing fascinating stories of love, loss and epic battles. A few years ago, Magnus Källström, a Swedish rune expert, travelled to a farm a few hours south of Stockholm to look at a stone covered in ancient runic writing. A farmer had found the stone in a field and had planned to use it as a doorstep until he turned it over and saw rows of ancient, twig-like signs: runes, used by Vikings around 1,000 years ago. When Källström arrived, the residents at the farm and local archaeologists gathered around him as he stumbled at the first word, then read the text out loud. Word by word, he was voicing a message no-one had read or heard in almost a millennium: ""Gärder erected this stone in memory of Sigdjärv his father, Ögärd's husband."" As surprising as this discovery may sound, it's not uncommon for ancient rune stones to turn up by chance in modern-day Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. They emerge as people build bike lanes or plough their fields. Some are extremely old and date to the earliest days of this mysterious script, such as an up to 2,000-year-old rune stone discovered in Norway in 2023. Over their lifetime, some simply ended up as raw material for construction, smashed to pieces to provide a house foundation or accidentally covered in granite under a church doorstep. For ordinary Swedes like me, the stones are also a familiar part of the scenery. They appear in fields and meadows, in the middle of roundabouts and in industrial parks. Specific signs point to heritage sites near roads, often containing runes – signs that I, once a child stuck in the backseat of the family car on holidays, still associate with boredom. And yet, despite this familiarity, the stones and the enigmatic writing on them still hold many surprises and unsolved puzzles. The word ""rune"" stems from the Old Norse word rún, which means secret. Runic writing, a script that has many variations but usually consists of 24 or, later, 16 letters, was first used in northern Europe some 2,000 years ago. It was invented, researchers believe, when merchants and travellers from northern Europe came across scripts such as the Latin alphabet on their trips to southern Europe. They then used those scripts to come up with their own form of writing, capturing northern European languages such as Old Norse. Runes were written on a range of materials, including wood, bone and stone, and even on ordinary tools. ""Do you think of me, I think of you, do you love me, I love you"", says a message on a textile tool from the end of the 11th Century, found outside Gothenburg. Stone texts, however, are the most durable and visible form. Runic writing can even be found on cliffs, though most commonly, it appears on rune stones: inscribed stone slabs that are often human-height or taller; rune stones. Rune stones were put up as ""memorial stones, often erected where people pass by, roads and fords and council places and such, visible and public"", says Källström, the foremost expert of runes of the Swedish National Heritage Board. The stones became popular in Scandinavia from around 300 AD, but their golden age is associated with Viking times, between the years 800-1050 AD. In fact, the stones have even been described as the social media of the Viking Age. However, commissioning a stone wouldn't have been cheap, Källström explains, and often, a professional carver was employed. ""You can suspect that it wasn't for just anybody,"" he says. They were popular during the time missionaries brought Christianity to Sweden, Källström says, and the scripts often included references to the new faith, such as calls for prayers to be read for the dead, alongside decorations of crosses. But runes were used more informally, too, for jokes, riddles and puns, according to Källström. He gives the example of animal bones carved with runes for training. When read from one direction and then turned 180 degrees for the rest of the text, they spell out messages like: ""ráð þat"" (decipher this), or, ""ǫl gott"", (tasty beer). ""So that's a form of Viking party trick, like: 'What does this say?',"" he says of the riddle bones. ""That's one of my favourites."" Most of the stones were erected in what is today southern Sweden and southern Norway. Others can be found in Denmark, on Iceland and in the UK, where runes were used to write Old English. Some have even been found as far east as in Turkey or as far west as Greenland, showing how widely the Viking culture was spread, through epic voyages and invasions. In all, there are around 7,000 known rune inscriptions around the world. As Christianity and influences from the rest of the world took further hold of Sweden in the 1100s, the runic script started falling out of use, replaced by Latin letters. Today, the stones have faded to grey, but in their time, they were typically painted with natural dyes in an eye-catching colour, such as pink. The texts of them tend to follow a standard format, marking someone's death, sometimes with additions about what they achieved in life and with well-wishes for their afterlife: ""Here shall these stones stand, reddened with runes: Guðlaug raised [them] in memory of her sons; and Hjalmlaug in memory of her brothers,"" reads one stone from around 1,000 AD, found west of Stockholm. ""Tóla placed this stone in memory of Geirr, her son, a very good valiant man. He died on a Viking raid on the western route,"" reads another stone from roughly the same era, around 1,000 AD, found north-west of Gothenburg. The stones sometimes also had a practical purpose, marking borders or stating an old form of land inheritance rights, known as odal in Old Swedish. Some evoke dramatic conflicts. ""Bjǫrn, Finnviðr's son, had this rock-slab cut in memory of Óleifr, his brother,"" says one in northern Stockholm, also from about 1,000 AD. ""He was betrayed at Finnheiðr. May God help his spirit. This estate is the allodial land and family inheritance of Finnviðr's sons at Elgjastaðir."" And some reveal glimpses of love, loyalty and private grief, as in the case of a stone found near the town of Sala: ""The good husbandman Holmgautr had (the stone) raised in memory of Óðindísa, his wife. There will come to Hǫsumýrar no better housewife, who arranges the estate. Red-Balli carved these runes. Óðindísa was a good sister to Sigmundr."" A man called Jarlabanke raised several, many still standing along the road bank he constructed. All honoured… himself. As one said: ""[Jarlabanke] had these stones raised in memory of himself while alive, and made this bridge for his spirit, and (he) alone owned all of Tábýr. May God help his spirit.""  For Källström and other experts, the craftspeople who carved the stones can become recognisable by their style. This has helped piecing together broken and dispersed rune stones, completing jigsaws and spelling out messages that had been scattered for centuries. Apart from letting us into the Vikings' lives and deaths, runes may also tell us about the wider world of the time – including the climate. The sleepy village of Rök sits on a plain some 250 kilometres south west of Stockholm. Here, under a specially-built roof outside the local church, stands the Rök stone, the focus of one of the biggest debates gripping rune scholars today. Erected in the 9th Century, a few hundred years before the runestone boom and when Sweden was still mainly pagan, it carries the world’s longest rune text. ""After Vamoth stand these runes,"" it starts. ""And Varin, the father, made them after the death-doomed son."" Then follows line after line of riddles. For a long time, the text was understood to be related to Gothic king Theoderic and to heroic deeds. But over the last decades, bit by bit, this interpretation has been questioned. The text’s themes about a father grieving his dead son were highlighted, and in 2020, Professor of Runology at Uppsala University Henrik Williams, Professor of Scandinavian Languages at the University of Gothenburg Per Holmberg and their colleagues suggested that the stone tells of our dependency on the weather – specifically about a cold snap three centuries earlier, caused by volcanic eruptions and leading to many deaths. I visit it a day in June. As I approach the stone, gusts of wind tug at the crops in the fields surrounding the church. Church bells are ringing and an elderly couple exit the graveyard and drive away in their car. Then, I am alone. Everything, except the wind, is quiet. I lean against the stone and find it is steady. I cannot believe anyone can read the enigmatic red patterns etched into it, but later, I listen to a clip of Professor Williams reading the inscription aloud: a ghostly, insistent call from the distant past. The new interpretation of the Rök text made headlines around the world. But does it say more about the modern lens through which we look at history than of history itself? ""Each era has its interpretive frameworks,"" Holmberg says when I ask him. Nationalism was popular in the early 1900s, and the old King Theoderic interpretation has ""certain nationalistic overtones"" which matches this well, he explains. Similarly, he says, some of his colleagues have cautioned that the new climate interpretation may be based on reading the text in the light of our own current worries about global warming. However, in his view, the climate interpretation makes sense because past societies did worry about the climate and weather: ""It becomes kind of a funny thing, like, 'the Vikings had climate anxiety', as it was written in the press a little jokingly,"" he says. ""But everyone had climate anxiety before the breakthrough of the industrial and modern world. People thought: 'How are we going to cope? Aren't the harvests worse now than before, than in my dad's time?' [Climate] has [always] been the big topic of conversation."" Holmberg suggests that there are clues in the way the stone is placed, and even its font sizes and angles. Maybe, he says, it was meant to point to the sun at the spring and autumn equinox, or to certain stars, and these natural features would have been part of the riddle and its solution. Henrik Williams, who wrote a book about the Rök stone, says it is difficult to interpret. ""I think the stone worked the same way religion does today at funerals, when the priest talks about the Bible or so,"" he says. It uses myths to console the grieving: ""The son is said to travel to Odin and then he fights in Ragnarök, the final battle. He has died prematurely, so this thought gives his dad comfort."" I leave Rök and cycle on, the wind in my back. Soon, I pass a pair of metre-high, worn-down rune stones, easy to miss in the grass along the road. They are bathed in the swishing noise of the rotating blades of a nearby wind farm. Today, some people still experiment with and imitate runic writing. Rune-like artwork decorates my mum's underground station in Stockholm. The signs are used in playful online quizzes where you can find out your own ""birth rune"", tapping into a Viking belief that linked runes to dates and predicted destinies. But there is also a darker side to the modern-day use of runes: ever since the Nazis appropriated runes and Old Norse mythology to construct the idea of a Nordic race, what was originally a practical, border-crossing writing system has been used as a symbol of racist views and far-right sympathies. Cycling through the Swedish countryside, past these millennia-old inscriptions, I see the familiar stones with new eyes. Because of their sheer size and weight, the stones can't just be gathered up easily like old manuscripts, and instead they are still scattered across the landscape. Moving them requires major effort. In fact, the day before our planned interview, Källström emailed me to reschedule, because he had to go supervise the tractor move of a restored stone to the church where it is normally on display. As for the stone that was found by a farmer, and which Källström read out to a small, spontaneous crowd: it's been moved from the field, and now stands in front of grassy slopes and trees, secured in a concrete casting.

10,BBC,Five golds including big air on day one  - Saturday's Winter Olympics guide,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/c338y36kngzo,"The 25th Winter Olympics will feature almost 3,000 athletes from 90 countries competing for 116 medals at Milan-Cortina. Team GB have sent 53 athletes to the Games with plenty of medal potential. The action actually starts a couple of days before the opening ceremony. Here is your guide to what is happening each day and who to look out for. All times GMT. All you need to know about the 2026 Winter Olympics How does curling work? Medals: Five Medal events: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50); Women's cross country - skiathlon (12:00-13:50); Women's speed skating 3000m (15:00-1650); Women's ski jumping - normal hill (17:45-20:00); Men's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05). Freestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35) Kirsty Muir has had her struggles since reaching the Olympic final four years ago â including recovering from a torn ACL â but the 21-year-old Scot comes to Italy on the back of winning X Games gold in January and her first World Cup gold last year. Defending Olympic champion Mathilde Gremaud and China's US-born superstar Eileen Gu are both competing but Italian teenager Flora Tabanelli, the current Youth Olympic champion, has not made the start list after suffering a serious knee injury in November. Alpine skiing: Men's downhill (10:30-12:50) The first medals of these Olympics could quite feasibly all go the way of Switzerland. Back-to-back World Cup champion Marco Odermatt will start as slight favourite ahead of compatriot and 2025 world champion Franjo von Allmen. Another Swiss star, Alexis Monney, will head to the Games as Stelvio's most recent World Cup downhill winner â could he, ahem, cash in on gold ahead of his team-mates? Austria's Vincent Kriechmayr will have something to say about that, while Giovanni Franzoni, who won the recent Kitzbuhel downhill and veteran Dominik Paris, 36, will carry the weight of expectation for the host nation. Snowboard: Men's big air (18:30-19:50) Twelve of the world's top snowboarders will be showing off their tricks in one of the most spectacular sports on the Winter Olympic programme. It looks like an open competition but Japan's team is full of talent, including reigning world champion Ryoma Kimata and overall World Cup winner Taiga Hasegawa. Mixed doubles curling round robin matches continue. There's no rest for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds, who are in action twice today for the third day running. At 09:05 they face Canada's husband-and-wife pair Brett Gallant and Jocelyn Peterman. Then at 13:35 they're up against 2023 world champions Korey Dropkin and Cory Thiesse of the USA, who are making their Olympic debut. Men's freeski slopestyle qualifying starts at 13:00, with defending Olympic champion and 2024â25 World Cup winner Alex Hall of the USA looking like the man to beat. Get to know the Team GB Winter Olympics squad How Team GB Winter Olympians beat The Fear Vonn, Gu and Malinin - global stars to follow at Milan-Cortina 2026 Medals: Eight Medal events: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50); Men's cross-country 10km skiathlon (11:30-13:00); Men's and women's snowboard parallel giant slalom (12:00-13:40); Biathlon â mixed relay  (13:05-14:40); Men's speed skating 5000m (15:00-17:20); Men's luge (16:00-19:40); Team figure skating (18:30-22:05). Snowboard: Parallel giant slalom (08:00-14:00) Czech superstar Ester Ledecka takes aim at an unprecedented third consecutive Olympic gold in the women's parallel giant slalom. Ledecka made history in 2018 by becoming the first woman to win gold medals in two different sports by also winning the alpine skiing Super-G, and she could repeat the feat at these Games. Meanwhile, Austria's Claudia Riegler is set to become the oldest woman to compete at the Winter Olympics at the age of 52. Hosts Italy have several big hopes in the men's event, including reigning world champion Roland Fischnaller, who will be competing in his seventh Winter Olympics at the age of 45. Vonn made her Olympic debut aged 17 in Salt Lake City in 2002 Alpine skiing: Women's downhill (10:30-12:50) This race marks the return of legendary American skier Lindsey Vonn, six years after her retirement from the sport. Downhill is the 41-year-old's speciality and she's won a record 45 World Cup races in this event, plus her only Olympic gold medal in 2010. We will have to see how much of an affect crashing in the final World Cup downhill before the Winter Olympics hinders Vonn's bid. Keep an eye out for her superbly-named compatriot Breezy Johnson, who is the 2025 world champion. The host nation will be hopeful of at least one podium place, although World Cup champion Federica Brignone only returned to action in January, nine months after breaking multiple bones in her left leg and tearing her ACL during a giant slalom crash at the Italian Championships. Bergamo native Sofia Goggia took downhill silver four years ago despite suffering a knee injury just 23 days before the event. Cross country skiing: Men's skiathlon (11:30-12:50) It's a fifth Winter Olympics for Britain's Andrew Musgrave, whose best Olympic result is seventh in the skiathlon in 2018. In this event, competitors complete 10km using the classical technique before changing skis and doing 10km using the freestyle technique. Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the world champion and this could be the first of a bobble-hatful of golds for the Norwegian at these Games. Snowboard: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45) Britain's Mia Brookes has every chance of becoming Britain's youngest Winter Olympic medallist for 78 years. The rider from Cheshire has just turned 19 but has already won back-to-back big air World Cup titles and comes to Italy fresh from winning medals in the X Games. But she will face a stacked field, including Japan's Kokomo Murase, Reira Iwabuchi and Mari Fukada, who formed a clean sweep of the medals at last year's World Championships. Austria's Anna Gasser is aiming to win the event for the third Games in a row at the age of 34. Maisie Hill, whose career was almost ended by a horrific training accident three years ago, will be Britain's other representative. Figure skating: Team (20:55) The team figure skating competition concludes with the men's free skate. The USA won gold after the Russian team was demoted in Beijing in a protracted saga that delayed the medal ceremony by over two years. The USA are the reigning World Team Trophy champions and won three of the four individual events at last year's World Championships but Japan and Georgia will be pushing them hard.  Mixed doubles curling continues with another double-header for Britain's Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds in their final matches of the round robin stage. First up at 13:35 is Switzerland's husband-and-wife duo of Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-HÃ¼rlimann. Then at 18:05 there will be a big clash with home favourites and reigning Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini. It's a repeat of last year's World Championships final, which the Italians won. Medals: Five Medal events: Women's freestyle ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Men's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20); Women's speed skating 1000m (16:30-18:20); Women's snowboard big air (18:30-20:05); Men's ski jumping - normal hill (18:00-20:15). Freestyle skiing: Women's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10) Newly-crowned X Games champion Kirsty Muir, Team GB's youngest competitor at the last Winter Olympics, will be hoping to have reached the final for a second consecutive Games. The 21-year-old Scot returned from a torn ACL to win her first World Cup gold last year but would face high-class competition with the likes of reigning Olympic and world champion Mathilde Gremaud, China's superstar Eileen Gu and Italy's emerging 18-year-old talent Flora Tabanelli. Figure skating: Ice dance â rhythm dance (18:20-2200) Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson begin their campaign to win Britain's first figure skating medal since Dame Jayne Torvill and Sir Christopher Dean earned bronze in Lillehammer in 1994. The omens are good for the British pair â last year, they won GB's first figure skating World Championship medal in more than 40 years with bronze in Boston. Favourites are likely to be the USA's Madison Chock and Evan Bates, who have won the last three world titles. However, they will face a big challenge from new French pairing Guillaume Cizeron and Laurence Fournier Beaudry. Britain will also be represented by Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez. Snowboard: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50) British teenager Mia Brookes will be hoping to land a big trick â and an Olympic medal â in this event, which involves breathtaking acrobatics and mind-boggling bravery as competitors launch themselves into the air from a huge ramp. Anna Gasser has won both previous Olympic big air titles and the 34-year-old Austrian is back for a crack at a hat-trick. Japan's quartet of talented riders will also be in the mix. The curling mixed doubles semi-finals take place at 17:05 â Britain's former world champions Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds lost to Sweden at this stage four years ago, and will be hoping to be in a position to make amends today. Alpine skiing slides into new territory with the debut of the men's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) and a Swiss clean sweep is not out of the question â their first, second and fourth-choice pairings took gold, silver and bronze at the 2025 World Championships in Austria. Medals: Nine Medal events: Mixed team short track relay (09:30-12:30); Men's and women's cross-country skiing sprint classic (08:15-12:50); Men's ski slopestyle (11:30-13:20); Women's alpine skiing team combined (09:30-14:20), Men's biathlon 20km (12:30-14:30); Women's luge (16:00-18:50) Mixed doubles curling (17:05-19:25) Mixed team ski jumping (17:45-20:10). Freestyle skiing: Men's slopestyle final (11:30-13:10) The USA's Alex Hall bids to retain his Olympic title. He will have extra motivation to do so in Italy as his mother comes from Bologna and he will have plenty of family in Livigno to cheer him on. Hall had to settle for bronze at last year's World Championships, won by Norway's Birk Ruud â who won Olympic big air gold at Beijing 2022. Hall spent a lot of time on European slopes during his childhood Alpine skiing: Women's team combined (13:00) The women's team combined event (downhill at 09:30 and slalom at 13:00) makes its Olympic debut. Returning slalom legend Mikaela Shiffrin and USA downhill star Breezy Johnson won the maiden World Championship title in this event in early 2025 and will be the pair to beat here. Curling: Mixed doubles final (17:05-19:20) The mixed doubles is the only curling event in which Britain have never won a medal  â Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds will be hoping to be in a position to change that today. The pair were world champions in 2021 and runners-up last year but it's a tough field that includes reigning world and Olympic champions Amos Mosaner and Stefania Constantini, who are competing in front of their home crowd in Italy. Ice hockey: Women's preliminary round (19:10) The group A game between Canada and the USA is widely expected to be a dress rehearsal for next week's gold medal match given their dominance over the rest of the world. Six of the seven Olympic finals have been contested by the sides. Canada took gold in 2022 but the USA triumphed at last year's World Championship and have won the last six meetings. Most athletes don't get the chance to compete in one home Olympics but short track skater Arianna Fontana is about to appear in two. She will compete at Milan-Cortina 20 years after making her debut as a 15-year-old in Turin. We should get our first glimpse of her in the women's 500m (09:30), where she is the two-time defending champion. She may also feature in the mixed team relay final (11:56) â another Olympic medal would be her 12th. Ilia Malinin starts his quest for Olympic gold in men's figure skating (17:30). The American has only just turned 21 but comes to these Games as a two-time world champion. The women's singles luge medals will be decided (17:34) â and the chances are that gold will go to Germany, who have won the last seven Olympic titles. Natalie Geisenberger, the winner of the last three and one of the most successful female Winter Olympians in history, has retired, paving the way for one of her compatriots, headed by reigning world champion Julia Taubitz. Medals: Seven Medal events: Men's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's moguls (10:00-14:15); Women's biathlon 15km (13:15-15:10); Men's speed skating 1000m (17:30-19:00); Luge doubles (16:30-19:40); Figure skating ice dance (18:30-22:15). Alpine skiing: Men's super-G (10:30-12:50) Swiss speedster Marco Odermatt will be the man to beat if the 2025 season is anything to go by â the 28-year-old finished almost 300 points clear of his nearest rival Vincent Kriechmayr of Austria in the World Cup rankings and also claimed the World Championship title in February. Shocks do occur in this sport, however, like Ryan Cochran-Siegle's silver in Beijing four years ago. The American won't be a medal favourite in Milan but every time he's reached a World Cup podium it has been on Italian snow. Ice hockey: Men's preliminary round (15:40) The opening game of the men's ice hockey is a high-profile clash between Finland and Slovakia, the 2022 gold and bronze medallists respectively. The return of NHL players to the Olympics for the first time since 2014 means team rosters will be stacked with world-class talent. Both sides will be vying to win Group B as that would mean they advance directly to the quarter-finals without having to contest an extra match in the play-off round. Luge: Men's & women's doubles (16:00) Officially, women's doubles is the only new luge event at these Olympics but technically men's doubles is one too, as it was previously open to both sexes, albeit it was always men who took part. The women's event might offer an opportunity for a rare non-German winner, with Austria's Selina Egle and Lara Kipp winning the last two world titles. In the men's doubles, Germany's Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt are aiming to win gold for a remarkable fourth consecutive Games. There are two runs in each event, with the women's second run at 17:53 and the men's second run at 18:44. Curling: Men's round robin (18:05-21:05) Britain's men, skipped by Bruce Mouat, had a phenomenal 2024-25 campaign, winning the world title and becoming the first rink ever to win four Grand Slam events in one season. Now they are targeting the Olympic title that has so far eluded them, although they came mightily close in 2022, losing to Sweden in the gold medal match. GB begin their campaign against China, who had to come through the last-chance qualifying competition in December. Figure skating: Ice dance â free dance (18:30-22:05) Britain's Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson have their eyes on the podium as the ice dance reaches its conclusion. Duos from the USA and France are likely to battle it out for gold and silver but Fear and Gibson, who won World Championship bronze last year, are hoping to become the first British figure skaters since Torvill and Dean in 1994 to earn an Olympic medal. Britain's Phebe Bekker and James Hernandez will also be competing. USA's Chloe Kim has overcome a recent injury to begin her quest for a third straight Olympic gold in the women's snowboard halfpipe, with qualification at 09:30. This will be the first Olympic men's snowboard halfpipe competition (18:30) since 2002 that hasn't featured USA superstar Shaun White. The top 12 qualifiers in the men's and women's events advance to the final. Can anyone stop the Dutch in the men's 1000m speed skating (17:30)? They have won gold in this event at each of the past three Games, with the now-retired Thomas Krol taking the title in 2022. Defending champion Jakara Anthony bids to become the first Australian to win two Winter Olympic gold medals in the women's moguls final (13:15). Medals: Nine Medal events: Men's moguls (09:00-12:35); Women's Super-G (10:30-12:50); Women's cross-country 10km interval (12:00-14:00); Men's snowboard cross (09:00-14:25); Women's speed skating 5000m (17:30-19:10); Mixed Luge team relay  (17:30-18:55); Women's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's 500m and men's 1000m short track (19:15-21:20). Skeleton: Men's heats one and two (08:30-11:00) Beijing 2022 marked the first Winter Olympics in which Great Britain failed to win a medal in skeleton but there is every hope of putting that right in Milan-Cortina. Matt Weston dabbled with rugby and taekwondo before finding skeleton but could now become Britain's first male Olympic champion in the sport. Weston was 15th on his Olympic debut in Beijing but has made huge progress since Two-time reigning world champion Weston dominated at the World Cup this season, while team-mate Marcus Wyatt is also among the medal contenders at these Games. The first two of four runs take place today (08:30 and 10:08) on the new track in Cortina, with the final the next day. Alpine skiing: Women's Super-G (10:30) This event promises to be one of the most entertaining â and open â of the entire Games. Home hopes lie with all-rounder Sofia Goggia, while 34-year-old Swiss star Lara Gut-Behrami is seeking to retain her Olympic title before retiring from the sport. 2018 Olympic champion Ester Ledecka and returning legend Lindsey Vonn will be in the mix, as will newcomer Emma Aicher of Germany. Mexico's Sarah Schleper, soon to be 47, will be making all kinds of history as she competes in her seventh Winter Olympics. She'll be the oldest female alpine skier ever to compete at the Games, and the first woman to compete at three or more Winter Olympics for two different nations, having represented the USA from 1998 to 2010. Furthermore, her teenage son Lasse Federico Gaxiola has also been selected in alpine skiing, making them the first mother and son to compete at the same edition of an Olympic Winter Games. Snowboard: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American Chloe Kim is aiming to become the first woman to win three consecutive Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. The 25-year-old American took two years off after winning gold in Beijing but picked up right where she left off on her return. She comes to Milan-Cortina as the reigning world champion and the favourite for gold, and says she's ""good to go"" despite dislocating her shoulder in early January. Short track: Women's 500m & men's 1000m (19:15-20:50) It could be a good day for hosts Italy. Veteran skater Arianna Fontana, competing in her sixth Olympics, is bidding for a third consecutive gold in the shortest of the short track distances. Anything can happen in the unpredictable sport of short track, which provided one of the all-time famous Winter Olympic moments when Australian Steven Bradbury took gold in the men's 1000m in 2002 after the other competitors wiped out. That final will also be held tonight and Italy have a live-wire contender in Pietro Sighel. Britain's Niall Treacy will be hoping to make an impression over his favoured distance. Women's curling gets under way, with Rebecca Morrison leading Great Britain's team, who start their campaign against China at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain face a rematch of the 2022 Olympic final â which they lost â against Niklas Edin's Sweden rink (13:05). Buoyed by the availability of NHL players for the first time since 2014, Canada and the USA play their opening group games in the men's ice hockey. Nine-time gold medallists Canada take on the Czech Republic at 15:40 while the USA â who haven't lifted the title since 1980 â face Latvia at 20:10. The luge team relay (17:30) is always an entertaining watch and has been extended to four legs at these Games, with the addition of women's doubles. Germany have won gold all three previous times it has been held and will be favourites once again. The fast-paced and exciting snowboard cross begins with the men's competition today (09:00). Huw Nightingale goes for Britain. Medals: Seven Medal events: Men's cross-country 10km (11:00-12:55); Women's snowboard cross  (09:00-14:10) Men's biathlon 10km sprint (13:00-14:40); Men's speed skating 10,000m (15:30-17:10); Men's snowboard halfpipe (18:30-20:20) Men's skeleton (18:30-21:20); Men's figure skating (18:00-22:15). Snowboard: Women's snowboard cross (09:00-14:05) Britain's former world champion Charlotte Bankes has enjoyed plenty of success in snowboard cross but the Winter Olympics have so far produced only frustration. Bankes, who was born in Hemel Hempstead but grew up in the French Alps, has competed at three previous Games (twice for France) but is yet to make the final. She has overcome recent injury to get back to the top of the World Cup podium so she should have every chance in Livigno. Figure skating: Men â free skate (18:00-22:10) We are likely to see the Olympic coronation of two-time world champion Ilia Malinin, who remains the only skater to have landed the incredibly difficult quad Axel in competition and is probably one of the hottest favourites of these Games. If the American's free skate is anything like the routine that clinched the Grand Prix Trophy in December, it should be spectacular. That routine featured an astonishing seven quadruple jumps. Skeleton: Men's heats three and four (18:30-21.20) Will Friday the 13th be a lucky one for either Matt Weston or Marcus Wyatt, who are both vying to become Britain's first male Olympic skeleton champion? The final two runs of the competition (18:30 and 20:05) will decide the medals with reigning world champion Weston already having a win on the Cortina track under his belt this season. The women's competition also begins today (15:00), with Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman and Freya Tarbit all competing for Team GB. Snowboard: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) American legend Shaun White may have retired but there will still be plenty of gasp-inducing acrobatics as riders drop into the pipe to show off their bag of tricks. Reigning world and X Games champion Scotty James won bronze in 2018 and silver in 2022 â is it finally the Australian's time to grab gold? Women's ice hockey enters the knockout phase, with two quarter-finals taking place. The second round of group games in the men's tournament also gets under way, with four fixtures, including Finland against Sweden at 11:10. The Finns are the reigning champions, while Sweden finished fourth in Beijing. Both have named squads packed full of NHL talent. Britain's men's curling team face hosts Italy at 09:05, while in women's curling, GB take on South Korea at 13:05. Medals: Eight Medal events: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:05), Women's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Men's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 7.5k sprint (13:00-14:35); Women's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Women's skeleton (17:00-19:50), Men's ski jumping large hill (17:45-20:05); Women's short track 3000m relay (19:15-22:10). Alpine skiing: Men's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30) Switzerland's Marco Odermatt has claimed four successive World Cups in this event and is attempting to do something that not even greats like Marcel Hirscher and Hermann Maier could manage â back-to-back Olympic gold medals in giant slalom. The only man to achieve this feat was an Italian â Alberto Tomba in Calgary 1988 and Albertville 1992 â so could the slopes of Bormio in the extreme north of the country prove a lucky omen for the Swiss superstar? Freestyle skiing: Women's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Today we'll see the first-ever Olympic champion in dual moguls, in which skiers compete head-to-head on adjacent courses. The USA's Jaelin Kauf, who was the silver medallist in the moguls in Beijing, is the reigning world champion. However, she could face tough competition from teammate Tess Johnson. Skeleton: Women's heat three and four (17:00-19:50) It's the conclusion of the women's skeleton. This is an event that has traditionally been a very fruitful one for Great Britain, which has won medals on all but one of the six occasions the event has been held. Can Tabby Stoecker, Amelia Coltman or Freya Tarbit emulate the likes of Lizzy Yarnold, Amy Williams and Shelley Rudman? Muir has recovered from knee and shoulder surgery which kept her out of action for a year Freestyle skiing: Women's big air qualification (18:30-20:45) Britain's Kirsty Muir begins her campaign to better the fifth-place finish she achieved on her Olympic debut four years ago when aged just 17. Also likely to be in the field are China's California-born defending champion Eileen Gu, Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France and the sport's latest sensation, 18-year-old Flora Tabanelli. The Italian teenager, who won the Youth Olympic title in 2024, is the reigning world champion and has made a swift recovery from an ACL injury. The two remaining women's ice hockey quarter-finals take place, while in the men's preliminary round there's a rematch of the 2022 bronze medal game, won by Slovakia against Sweden (11.10am GMT). Round robin matches of the men's and women's curling continue, with Great Britain's women up against current world champions Canada at 09:05. Bruce Mouat's rink face the Czechs at 13:05. Britain's Niall Treacy will be among the competitors in the men's short track speed skating 1500m, with the quarter-finals getting under way at 7.15pm. Medals: Nine Medal events: Men's biathlon 12.5km pursuit (10:15-11:00); Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:05); Men's cross-country relay (11:00-13:00); Mixed team snowboard (10:00-14:05); Women's giant slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 10km pursuit (13:45-15:00); Men's speed skating team pursuit (15:00-17:05); Mixed team skeleton (17:00-19:00); Women's ski jumping - large hill (17:45-20:05). Alpine skiing: Women's giant slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30) After a 10th-place finish in Pyeongchang, Sweden's Sara Hector shocked many by taking giant slalom gold in Beijing. She became the first Swedish woman to win the Olympic title in this event since Pernilla Wiberg at Albertville 1992 and was helped by Mikaela Shiffrin's inability to complete a run. Freestyle skiing: Men's dual moguls (09:30-11:00) Can moguls king Mikael Kingsbury become the first-ever men's Olympic dual moguls champion? The Canadian is a five-time world champion in the discipline, and has won the last four, a run stretching back to 2019. His biggest rival is likely to be the only other man to have won the dual moguls world title in the past decade: Japan's Ikuma Horishima. Snowboard: Snowboard cross mixed team (12:45-14:00) This event made its debut in 2022, with American Lindsey Jacobellis capping a memorable Games by clinching her second gold alongside fellow veteran Nick Baumgartner. Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale finished sixth but went on to win the world title in 2023 and will be competing again today. Skeleton: Mixed team (17:00-19:00) The mixed team is a new event at these Winter Olympics. This is good news for Great Britain, presented with another medal chance in a sport that they have traditionally excelled in. The make-up of their two pairs is yet to be confirmed but Tabby Stoecker and Matt Weston have won silver at the past two World Championships and Britain will be hoping at least two of their squad are standing on the podium today. Ski jumping: Women's large hill (17:45) A landmark evening for ski jumping, with women competing for the first time in the large hill event. Slovenia's Nika Prevc, 20, may prove the woman to beat, having won gold on both the normal and large hill at last year's World Championships. The first day of competition in bobsleigh features the opening two women's monobob heats (09:00), in which British shot put champion Adele Nicoll will make her Olympic debut. The preliminary round of the men's ice hockey concludes with four games, including the USA against Germany (20:10). Only the three group winners plus the runner-up with the best record advance directly to the quarter-finals, with the other eight teams instead going into a play-off round. It's a busy day for Britain in men's curling â they play Germany at 09:05 and then return to the Cortina Curling Stadium to meet Switzerland at 18:05. At 13:05, the British women's team have a tricky fixture against Anna Hasselborg's Sweden. The long-established Swedish rink were 2018 Olympic champions before losing out to Team GB's Eve Muirhead and co in the 2022 semi-finals. Female figure skaters often hit their peak while teenagers but (sporting) life really did begin at 40 for Canadian pairs skater Deanna Stellato-Dudek, who along with Maxime Deschamps won her first world title at that age in 2024. Now 42, she and 34-year-old Deschamps will be among the medal contenders in the figure skating pairs, which starts today with the short programme (18:45). Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are Britain's first competitors in the Olympics pairs since 2014. Medals: Six Medal events: Women's short track 1000m (10:00-12:30); Men's slalom (09:00-14:20); Men's ski jumping super team (18:00-20:05); Women's freeski big air (18:30-20:05); Women's bobsleigh monobob (18:00-21:15); Pairs figure skating (19:00-22:10). Alpine skiing: Men's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30) Dave 'the Rocket' Ryding will compete in this event at his fifth and final Games. The 38-year-old slalom specialist became the first British alpine skier to win World Cup gold in 2022 and earlier this year he sealed the nation's best World Championship result by a male since 1934 by finishing sixth. However, he is not expected to reach the podium. Clement Noel of France is the defending Olympic champion, Switzerland's Loic Meillard the 2025 world champion and Henrik Kristoffersen is the most successful slalom skier ever produced by Norway, although Olympic gold has so far eluded him. Brookes first tried snowboarding aged only 18 months Snowboard: Women's slopestyle qualifying (09:30-11:35) Britain's Mia Brookes was too young to qualify for the last Winter Olympics but won the world title the following year, aged 16. Now just turned 19, she finally has her chance to grab Olympic glory and the rider from Sandbach, Cheshire, will be aiming to book her spot in tomorrow's final. Maisie Hill, who is back to her best after suffering a horrific training crash three years ago, will also represent Britain. Later today (13:00), the men's qualification takes place, with Txema Mazet-Brown Britain's only competitor. Bobsleigh: Women's monobob heats three and four (18:00) The first bobsleigh medal is up for grabs at the Cortina Sliding Centre. Kaillie Humphries won the inaugural monobob title at the 2022 Games, claiming her third Olympic gold â and first since switching allegiance from Canada to the USA. A fourth gold medal here would equal the record in Olympic bobsleigh. Freestyle skiing: Women's big air final (18:30-19:50) Kirsty Muir was the youngest member of Team GB in 2022, coming a brilliant fifth in the final, and the 21-year-old Scot will be hoping to be in the mix again. But it looks like being a high-class field that will include defending champion Eileen Gu and Beijing 2022 silver medallist Tess Ledeux of France. And all Italian eyes will be on Flora Tabanelli, who won the 2025 world title aged just 17 â the skier from Bologna is the reigning Youth Olympic champion in big air, and now has her eyes on the senior title. Women's ice hockey reaches the semi-final stage (15:40 and 20:10). Barring any surprises, Canada and the USA will be kept apart and will be red-hot favourites to advance to the final. Six of the seven previous women's gold medal games have been contested by those two countries. It's a busy Monday for Team GB in women's curling â Rebecca Morrison's rink play Denmark at 09:05 and Switzerland at 18:05. In men's curling, Britain's quest for gold continues with Team Mouat meeting Norway at 13:05. The figure skating pairs event reaches its conclusion (19:00), with reigning world champions Riku Miura and Ryuichi Kihara aiming to win Japan's first Olympic title in the discipline. The pair finished seventh at the last Games but have since finished either first or second at the last four World Championships. Anastasia Vaipan-Law and Luke Digby are competing for Great Britain. Medals: Seven Medal events: Men's Nordic combined (09:00-13:35); Women's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Men's biathlon 4 x 7.5km relay (13:30-15:10); Men's and women's speed skating team pursuit (13:30-16:25); Men's two-man bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's freeski big air (18:30-22:05). Snowboard: Women's slopestyle final (12:00-13:35) British teenager Mia Brookes has already won the world title and is now aiming to become an Olympic champion on snow, something no Briton had achieved prior to these Games. The 19-year-old will be putting her tricks up against some talented rivals, set to include the Japanese contingent and reigning Olympic and world champion Zoi Sadowski-Synnott of New Zealand. The riders have three runs to impress the judges, with their best score counting. Bobsleigh: Two-man heats three and four (18:00) Can anyone stop the Germans and in particular pilot Francesco Friedrich, who is vying for a record fifth bobsleigh gold? The 35-year-old led a German 1-2-3 in this event in 2022 but this season Friedrich's long-time rival Johannes Lochner has had a decisive edge on the World Cup circuit. The British sled, featuring Brad Hall and Taylor Lawrence, will be among those seeking to end Germany's stranglehold. Freestyle skiing: Men's big air final (18:30-19:50) New Zealand's Luca Harrington will be aiming to add the Olympic title to the world title and World Cup title he won last season. But defending champion Birk Ruud of Norway is unlikely to give up his crown without a fight, while the home crowd will be behind Miro Tabanelli, a 21-year-old Italian who claimed X Games gold in 2025. Women's figure skating begins with the short programme (17:45). It should be an intriguing competition with the likes of three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto up against the returning Alysa Liu, who dethroned the Japanese skater at last year's World Championships, and her American team-mate, the rejuvenated Amber Glenn. Britain's Kristen Spours, who has overcome a serious back injury to make it to Milan, will also be competing. Curling round robin matches continue. Britain's women have a rest day, with the men up against Canada (18:05), the only country to have won the men's Olympic title more than once. However, the last time they earned gold was 2014. Medals: Eight Medal events: Men's and women's cross-country team sprint (08:45-12:15); Women's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's snowboard slopestyle (12:00-13:50); Women's slalom (09:00-14:20); Women's biathlon 4 x 6km relay (13:45-15:20); Men's 500m and women's 3000m short track (19:15-21:00). Alpine skiing: Women's slalom (run one 09:00; run two 12:30) ""I don't want Beijing to be the reason that I'm scared of the Olympics,"" said former double Olympic champion Mikaela Shiffrin. ""For the past few years, it has been a little bit."" The 30-year-old endured a nightmare 2022, failing to finish the slalom, giant slalom and the slalom portion of the combined. Shiffrin became the youngest slalom gold medallist in Olympic history with her victory in Sochi in 2014 ""It's not so much about unfinished business,"" continued the American. ""It's more about making peace."" Her main rivals are likely to be Croatian 21-year-old and slalom World Cup winner Zrinka Ljutic and Camille Rast, who last year became the first Swiss racer since 1991 to win the slalom world title. Snowboard: Men's slopestyle (11:30-13:10) The last of the snowboard events at these Games should be a fascinating contest. Canadian veteran Mark McMorris, who has won slopestyle bronze at the last three Olympics, returns for a crack at an elusive gold, along with 2018 Olympic champion Red Gerard. Japan have a crop of exciting young stars. It's the quarter-finals in men's ice hockey, with the four winners from the previous day's play-off games taking on the four teams with the best record in the group stage. In curling, Great Britain's women return after a rest day to face the USA at 09:05 and Japan at 18:05. Britain's men meet the USA at 13:05 in the last of their round-robin matches. There'll be plenty of breathtaking acrobatics on display as the women's aerials final takes place (10:30). Can 35-year-old five-time Olympian Xu Mengtao of China retain her title? Medals: Seven Medal events: Men's aerials (10:30-12:05); Men's and women's ski mountaineering sprints (08:50-13:45); Men's Nordic combined team sprint (09:00-14:00); Men's 1500m speed skating (15:30-17:10); Women's ice hockey (18:10-21:10); Women's figure skating (1800-2215). Ski mountaineering: Women's and men's sprint finals (12:55 and 13:15) Bormio is synonymous with downhill skiing but some athletes will also be attempting to go uphill in the only new sport at these Winter Olympics â ski mountaineering, or skimo for short. Skiers race up and down a steep course on skis, 'skins' (strips of fabric attached to the bottom of skis) and on foot, putting on or taking off their equipment in transition areas between sections. Two of the three golds on offer will be decided today in the sprint races, which consist of several knockout contests. France's Emily Harrop, whose parents are British but who was born and bred in the French Alps, is the women's favourite (heats start at 08:50), with the men's heats at 09:30. Figure skating: Women's free skate (18:00-22:10) The women's figure skating is always one of the highlights of any Winter Olympics, but in 2022 it was one of the most upsetting events. It concluded with 15-year-old Kamila Valieva leaving the ice distressed after an error-strewn performance that followed her positive drugs test. The contest for gold in Milan-Cortina promises to be an intriguing battle â reigning world champion Alysa Liu and revitalised team-mate Amber Glenn are aiming to become the first USA winner of this title for 24 years, while Japan's three-time former world champion Kaori Sakamoto is hoping for a first Olympic gold in her farewell season. But could the latest young Russian talent Adeliia Petrosian â who will be competing as a neutral athlete â emerge as a contender? Ice hockey: Women's gold medal game (18:10) Thursday's final will almost certainly be the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter rivalry between the two dominant teams in women's hockey, Canada and the USA. The pair have contested six of the seven gold medal matches at the Olympic and met in 23 of 24 finals at World Championship level. The Canadians usually have the edge when it matters most and claimed their fifth Olympic crown in 2022. Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe run one and two (18:30-20:25) Zoe Atkin, one of Britain's biggest medal hopes at these Games, begins her quest to emulate big sister Izzy and win an Olympic medal. The 23-year-old Stanford University student is the reigning world champion and also the joint-winner of the overall World Cup title last season. However, she will face a strong field, including China's defending champion Eileen Gu and Li Fanghui, who was the other major force in the 2024-25 campaign. It's the final day of the curling round robin stage, with the semi-final line-ups to be determined and â in the case of the men's competition â played on the same day. Britain's women, led by Rebecca Morrison, face hosts Italy in their final round at 13:05 while Bruce Mouat and his GB men's team will be hoping to be involved in the men's semi-finals (18:05). Stolz made his Olympic debut in Beijing aged 17 Prepare for some gravity-defying tricks and jumps in the men's aerials final (10:30). Switzerland's Noe Roth has won the past two world titles but has not managed to land on the podium at either of the past two Olympics. A medal in Milano-Cortina would emulate his mother Colette Brand, who won aerials bronze in Nagano in 1998. Qi Guangpu is the defending champion. The men's speed skating 1500m (15:30) is regarded as one of speed skating's blue riband contests and is known by afficionados as the 'king's race'. US star Jordan Stolz, 21, came into these Games targeting gold in the 500m, 1000m and 1500m, with this competition potentially giving him the chance of a famous hat-trick. He has won all five of this season's World Cup races over 1500m. Medals: Six Medal events: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's biathlon 15km (13:15-14:20); Women's speed skating 1500m (15:30-17:10); Men's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's short track 1500m and men's short track 5000m relay (19:15-21:40). Freestyle skiing: Women's ski cross (09:00-12:35) The exciting sport of ski cross involves plenty of drama and the last Olympics was no exception, as Switzerland's Fanny Smith well knows. She was demoted from bronze in the aftermath of her race, only for the decision to eventually be overturned â she received her medal more than a year later. Now the reigning world champion, Smith again faces Sweden's Sandra Naeslund and Canada's Marielle Thompson, the gold and silver medallists from Beijing. Ice hockey: Men's semi-finals (15:40 & 20:10) The Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena is host to a semi-final double header, with the two winners advancing to Sunday's final and the losers playing off for bronze. Canada are nine-time Olympic champions, while the USA last took the title in 1980. Freestyle skiing: Men's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) Expect a thrilling contest for gold. With New Zealand's 2022 gold medallist Nico Porteous announcing last summer that he was stepping away from the sport, there is a gap to be filled â and the title could stay in Kiwi hands as 19-year-old Finley Melville Ives is the current world champion. Alex Ferreira won silver in 2018 and bronze in 2022, and fellow American Nick Goepper has his sights set on winning a medal at a fourth consecutive Games, having made the slopestyle podium in 2014, 2018 and 2022. It's semi-finals day in the women's curling (13:05) and, as the defending champions, Team GB will be hoping to be involved. However, Jen Dodds is the only returning member of the successful GB quintet in 2022, and Rebecca Morrison's 2026 rink will probably be hopeful rather than expectant of reaching this stage. It's also the bronze-medal match in the men's curling (18:05). Medals: 10 Medal events: Men's team aerials (09:45-11:35); Men's ski cross (09:00-12:40); Men's cross-country 50km mass start (10:00-13:05); Mixed ski mountaineering relay (12:30-13:50); Women's biathlon 12.5km mass start (13:15-14:15); Men's and women's speed skating mass start (14:00-17:00); Women's ski halfpipe (18:30-20:20); Women's two-woman bobsleigh (18:00-21:10); Men's curling (1805-2135). Freestyle skiing: Men's ski cross final (09:00-12:35) Beijing champion Ryan Regez suffered a torn ACL followed by a loss of form but his world title win last year shows he is now back to his best. His biggest threat could be Canada's Reece Howden, who has won the World Cup title in both of the past two years. Bobsleigh: Two-woman heats three and four (18:00 & 20:03) Germany's Laura Nolte won this event in 2022 aged 23, becoming the youngest female pilot to take gold. Since then, she and brakewoman Deborah Levi have been a model of consistency on the World Cup circuit. The USA's Kaillie Humphries won this event in 2010 and 2014 and could run Nolte close. Atkin was ninth in the event at Beijing 2022 Curling: Men's gold-medal game (18:05-21:20) Britain's Team Mouat will be hoping to be involved as the men's curling reaches its conclusion. The quartet who competed in the 2022 final are all back in Milan-Cortina and determined to upgrade the silver they took home last time to gold, which would be Britain's first in Olympic men's curling since 1924. The bronze medal game in the women's curling starts at 13:05 GMT. Freestyle skiing: Women's halfpipe final (18:30-20:05) Can Britain's Zoe Atkin dethrone China's Eileen Gu as the Olympic champion? The US-born 21-year-old is the reigning world champion but will be up against a stacked field, likely to also include Li Fanghui, her biggest rival last season and the skier with whom she shared the overall 2024-25 World Cup title. As well as the conclusion of the two-woman event, the opening two heats of the four-man bobsleigh take place (09:00 and 10:57). Germany â particularly pilot Francesco Friedrich â have monopolised major titles in recent years but the British crew driven by Brad Hall also have podium aspirations. The most gruelling event in the Winter Olympics is cross country skiing's 50km mass start (10:00). The men's medals will be decided on Saturday and current world champion Johannes Hosflot Klaebo is the red hot favourite. Team GB's Andrew Musgrave is competing in his fifth Winter Olympics. Medals: Four Medal events: Men's four-man bobsleigh (09:00-12:20); Women's cross-country 50km mass start (09:00-12:35); Women's curling (12:05-13:35); Men's ice hockey (12:40-15:40) Bobsleigh: Four-man heats three and four (09:00 & 11:12) History beckons for German great Francesco Friedrich on the final day of the Games. The 35-year-old arrived in Italy with four Olympic titles so, depending on how he fared in the earlier two-man event, he will be vying to become the first athlete to win five or even six bobsleigh golds. His biggest rival may be Germany's second crew, headed by Johannes Lochner, but Team GB could also be in podium contention, with the sled piloted by Brad Hall having recorded encouraging results occasionally at the top level. Finland celebrate after beating the Russian Olympic Committee team 2-1 in the final in Beijing Curling: Women's gold medal game (10:05-13:20) This event proved the highlight â and saving grace â of Britain's Winter Olympics four years ago, when Eve Muirhead and her team clinched GB's only gold of the Games on the final day in Beijing. With only one member of that gold-winning quintet competing in Milan-Cortina, a repeat might be unlikely. Ice hockey: Men's gold medal game (13:10) Each of the last three men's ice hockey finals has produced a different winner â so could a new name be added to the roll of honour at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena? Canada have claimed a record nine Olympic golds and the return of NHL players is a boost to their chances. That also applies to the USA, who haven't won the title since 1980's 'Miracle on Ice', while Finland are the reigning champions. With all events completed, at 19:00 it's time for the Closing Ceremony of the XXV Winter Olympic Games, which will take place in the iconic Arena, a Roman amphitheatre in the historic city of Verona. Milan Cortina will say arrivederci and perform the traditional handover to the team from the French Alps, where the 2030 Games will be held."
11,BBC,Why it's becoming harder to be a Winter Olympian,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260206-why-its-becoming-harder-to-compete-at-the-winter-olympics,"A warming climate and the use of artificial snow is making it more dangerous and difficult to compete at the Winter Olympics. In the Italian Dolomites, snow machines will pump out a total of 50,000 cubic metres (1.76 million cubic feet) of artificial snow over the next two weeks, to ensure pristine conditions for the skiing and snowboarding events at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. Situated at an altitude of 1,816m (5,958ft), Cortina d'Ampezzo in the Dolomites, has plenty of snowfall. Despite this, event organisers tell the BBC that artificial snow will account for 85% of total snow at the Games, ""to guarantee athletes the highest-quality surface, ensuring fair and safe competition conditions throughout the entire event"". But coaches, athletes and researchers have expressed concerns about the use of artificial snow, which they say is making snow sports more unpredictable and dangerous, increasing their risk of injury and making training more difficult and expensive. It has been almost 50 years since artificial snow was first used at the Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. In the past decade, event organisers have become increasingly reliant on the technology to maintain conditions as mountain snowfall continues to decline globally and snow seasons have become shorter. The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing were the first Games to depend entirely on artificial snow. Britain's most decorated Paralympian Menna Fitzpatrick tells the BBC that ""with winter conditions changing so much, artificial snow plays a big role in keeping races running and the calendar consistent"". The Para-Alpine skier, who has six Paralympic medals, says that ""from a racing point of view, that reliability is really important"". Fitzpatrick will be competing at the Paralympics in early March after recovering from a serious knee injury in December. But reliability comes with risks. Athletes are at greater likelihood of injury when competing on artificial snow, which is harder, icier and denser than natural snow, as it traps less air in its structure, according to a 2022 report by Loughborough University in the UK. The environmental impact of artificial snow At this year's Winter Games, roughly 27,000 cubic metres (953,000 cubic feet) of water will be used to make artificial snow, the equivalent of 11 Olympic-size swimming pools. Snowmaking can be a carbon intensive process if the machines run on polluting fossil fuels, though this year's Games are using 100% renewable power for it. Studies have found that artificial snow can also disrupt plant growth. The IOC says that no chemicals will be added to the snow at this year's Games. ""It's the difference between falling on the pavement and falling on grass,"" says Madeleine Orr, one of the report's authors and an assistant professor of sport ecology at the University of Toronto in Canada and formerly at Loughborough, whose research focuses on how climate change impacts sport. She says she has noticed trends in the data on injury rates. ""People aren't falling more on artificial snow, but when they do fall, it's a harder surface, and therefore there is a higher risk of injury."" In the 2022 report, athletes and coaches expressed concern about the increase in injuries and the impact climate change is having on training and competitive events. When ""freestyle super pipes are formed from snow-making machines in a poor [natural snow] season, the walls of the pipe are solid, vertical ice and the pipe floor is solid ice,"" says Laura Donaldson, a Scottish freestyle skier, who competed at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. ""This is dangerous for athletes, some have died."" However not all athletes feel artificial snow use is a significant change. ""As athletes we're pretty used to training and racing in all sorts of environments, so artificial snow is just another part of that,"" says Fitzpatrick. ""I grew up skiing on indoor slopes in Britain, so it's never really felt out of the ordinary for me,"" she adds. ""Ski racing will always come with risks, and that's something we all accept,"" she says. ""Injuries are part of the sport, and while we work hard to reduce the risks, there are so many variables that I don't see artificial snow as a key issue."" The IOC says that ""athlete safety is the primary consideration in course preparation"". The changing snow conditions and weather patterns are also significantly altering training for many athletes, by shortening seasons and making teams travel further. The teams are ""chasing the snow and it's getting harder"", says Orr. ""The amount of time you spend on the slopes matters. You can't push yourself safely [in the competition] if you don't have conditions to train in."" More like this: The lost Olympic sport of 'distance plungingThe science-backed tips for cold weather exercise  Canadian freestyle skier Philippe Marquis has witnessed these changes first-hand, as a competitor and a coach. Marquis competed in the men's mogul events at the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in 2014 and Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018. He says he experienced extreme weather changes during his Olympic career. ""One year you'd hit the jackpot with a huge dump of snow and then the next there would be rain or it would be extremely warm or cold,"" Marquis says. He currently coaches the Canadian freestyle mogul team and says that in recent years training ""has been extremely tough due to the extreme variability of the weather. Athletes and coaches are having to adapt."" The Canadian team has, for example, been unable to train at Whistler Blackcomb during the summer season in the past two years due to declining snowpack and glacial melt, he says. ""We have basically lost a month and a half of training on home soil and are having to travel more to chase the snow."" The team now trains in South America instead of Whistler. ""There are fewer and fewer places around the world that get consistent natural snowfall,"" he says, adding that the financial burden of having to travel further and more often is ""putting a lot of pressure on athletes"".  Marquis says he has also noticed more injuries across the board, which he believes could be related to the use of artificial snow, as well as the rapidly changing conditions. ""I don't travel anywhere without a physio anymore… in mogul skiing, we are seeing more knee and back injuries."" He sees the hardness and iciness of artificial snow as a problem, especially for mogul skiers who are going down at 120km/h [75mph]. ""The margin of manoeuvre is that much tighter,"" he says. The increased risk of injury and the demanding travel schedule ""is taking a toll on a lot of professional athletes"", Marquis warns. The changing conditions may also lead to an ""economic downward spiral"", Orr says. ""If we have fewer skateable or skiable days, then fewer people can compete or participate on those days… which means they are going to be more expensive."" Rising ticket prices will lower demand for events and funding for snow sports, she argues, adding that the population that can afford to do these sports is decreasing along with the opportunities to take part. Snow sport opportunities are already declining, with the number of venues able to host the Winter Olympics shrinking rapidly due to rising temperatures and limited snowfall. Of the 21 venues used for the Winter Olympics since 1924, scientists say just 10 will have the ""climate suitability"" and natural snowfall levels needed to host an event by 2050. In a new study, researchers at the University of Waterloo in Canada analysed the climate conditions in the 93 potential host locations where the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has indicated that the necessary winter sports infrastructure is already in place. They found that only 52 of the locations would remain climate-reliable for the Olympics and 22 for the Paralympics if countries continue with current climate policies. But there are steps the IOC can take to futureproof the Games, the researchers say. By moving the Olympics forward by two weeks or hosting the Olympics and Paralympics simultaneously in February, the number of climate-reliable locations for the Paralympics would increase to 38. ""Another option is to have a rotating model,"" says Orr, where a small number of snow-secure venues take turns hosting the Games. The IOC has said it is considering this proposal. The Games ""must adapt to the hosts"", the IOC spokesperson says. ""Hosts should aim to use only existing or temporary venues, and can also move events outside the host city, region or country. Any new construction must be planned with long-term legacy in mind."" One thing is clear: snowmaking is essential to ensure the long-term viability of the Winter Games. ""Abandoning snowmaking would result in a major increase in unfair and unsafe conditions for athletes, cancelled competitions, and eventually a Winter Games without any snow sports,"" says Daniel Scott, the lead author of the new analysis and professor in the department of geography and environmental management at the University of Waterloo. Without artificial snowmaking, there are only four resorts in the world which could host the Winter Games, according to Orr. These are Niseko in Japan, Terskol in Russia, Val d'Isere and Courchevel in France. ""The takeaway is that snowmaking is essential and we must factor it into all future winter sports planning,"" she says. ""[Artificial] snow guarantees the quality and consistency of the courses,"" says the IOC spokesperson. Snowmaking, the use of clean energy and low-carbon transport are all solutions that ""help the Games and the host communities build resilience"". -- For essential climate news and hopeful developments to your inbox, sign up to the Future Earth newsletter, while The Essential List delivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

14,BBC,Will Sunday's snap election gamble pay off for Japan's first female premier?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgl53zll3jo,"Japan heads to the polls again on Sunday for its second general election in as many years. The snap vote has caught the ruling party, the opposition and much of the electorate off guard. Sanae Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, is betting on her personal popularity, hoping to succeed where her party failed just last year: delivering a clear public mandate for the long-ruling but deeply unpopular Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). It is a political gamble - one her predecessor, Shigeru Ishiba, made, and lost badly. Voters will now decide whether it will pay off. ""The difference this time is that her approval across most media polls has been much, much higher than her predecessors,"" says Rintaro Nishimura, an analyst and senior associate at The Asia Group's Japan Practice. ""Conventional wisdom says: when approval is high, you call an election."" Since taking office last October, Sanae Takaichi has dominated headlines, not through policy or legislation, but through political performance. The ""work, work, work"" mantra in her acceptance speech reinforced the image of an energised, relentless leader. In just over three months, she has cultivated a highly visible public profile. She's taken high-profile visits from world leaders, including receiving Donald Trump only a week into her premiership. When they appeared aboard the USS George Washington in Yokosuka, the prime minister raised her fists in the air as President Trump lavished her with praise. And just two days before February's vote, President Trump endorsed Takaichi saying she has ""already proven to be a strong, powerful, and wise leader... one that truly loves her country"". There was also her surprise appearance playing the song Golden from the film K-Pop Demon Hunters on the drums alongside South Korea's president, and the selfie with Italy's prime minister. These were all viral moments projecting confidence and momentum, and distanced her from the traditionally stagnant and at times boring image of her predecessors. ""There is an atmosphere of positivity about her being the first female prime minister in Japanese history, about her being successful at diplomacy… with her having approval ratings in the 60s or sometimes as high as 70%,"" says Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at Kanda University of International Studies. Professor Hall added that this image has been propped up by ""a large conservative group on the internet of users and social media influencers who provide a strong base for Takaichi, with posts showing her in a positive way going viral almost every day during the election"". ""So we have an atmosphere where users who log on to X [formerly Twitter]… the algorithm will be showing them very positive videos about Takaichi."" Takaichi has also consolidated support among the LDP's conservative base, reviving long-dormant goals such as constitutional revision and emphasising traditional values. ""She's positioned herself as the leader who brings the LDP back to its [conservative] origins,"" Nishimura says. ""That has resonated internally among party elders as well as with the LDP base."" Beyond the conservative base, Takaichi has connected with younger voters in a way not seen by a Japanese leader before. Her handbags and pink pens have become unlikely zeitgeist items. ""There's definitely an appeal among young people,"" Hall says. ""Young people tend to be the most disconnected from politics in Japan… but Takaichi has taken on this kind of idol-like, or celebrity-like, status among some young people."" He points to media reports of sana-katsu - obsessive fan activity inspired by idol culture. That personal appeal has translated into strong approval ratings which have hovered between the mid-fifties and high sixties, according to NHK and other major media polls. Koichi Nakano, associate professor of political science at Sophia University, says that despite initial grumbling when the snap election was announced, the LDP appears to be riding high on the prime minister's popularity. A recent Asahi Shimbun survey suggests the party is on track to gain significantly more than the 233 seats needed for a majority in the 8 February lower house election. ""If the party does well,"" Nakano says, ""many MPs will feel grateful. Their scandals will be washed clean, and they'll become very obedient."" A political funding corruption scandal that was revealed just over two years ago saw dozens of LDP lawmakers investigated over pocketing millions of dollars in proceeds from political fundraisers. It angered the public so much and cost party its majority in the 2024 election. The timing of the election has drawn criticism from opposition parties. They argue the snap vote has delayed anti-inflation measures, postponed debate over the fiscal 2026 budget, and placed an additional administrative burden on local municipalities. Hall says the primary motivation behind the timing was parliamentary arithmetic. ""The main purpose of calling the snap election when she did was to get back a parliamentary majority so that the new budget committee will be chaired by the LDP or a coalition partner,"" he says, allowing the budget to pass ""without opposition scrutiny"". The vote also comes in the depths of winter. Parts of northern Japan have been hit by heavy snow, raising concerns that bad weather could affect turnout. Last year's miscalculation also looms large over the ruling party. When Shigeru Ishiba called a snap election shortly after taking office, it backfired spectacularly, delivering one of the LDP's worst results in decades and costing the party its Lower House majority. ""When Ishiba called the election, the public was angry,"" Nakano says. ""There were financial scandals hanging over the LDP, and cost-of-living pressures were acute. This time, she has successfully distanced herself from that image."" Still, Nakano calls the strategy high-risk. ""She's created popularity by dissociating herself from the party's stagnant image,"" he says. ""But elections are about parties, not just personalities. That's the danger."" Since taking office, Takaichi has been on a diplomatic roll, but she has also managed to infuriate Japan's biggest trading partner, China. Relations have deteriorated sharply after her comments suggesting Japan could respond militarily if China attacked Taiwan, remarks she has refused to retract. The dispute escalated rapidly. Both sides lodged formal protests. Japan warned its citizens to stay safe in China, while Beijing urged its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan. Domestically, the row has strengthened Takaichi's standing. ""She is a hawk… a conservative,"" says 85-year-old voter Naoaki Yuhara. ""Of course, the economy is an important issue for the people, but at my age -especially when I think about my grandchildren's generation - national defence is very important, and she is seriously thinking about it."" But Takaichi's hawkishness on defence worries Haruka, a voter in her 30s. ""I am concerned about the defence issue. We don't know where exactly the money is being spent or how. I do worry that they may spend money on things like nuclear weapons or the use of military forces,"" she told the BBC. ""I worry that it may be happening behind our backs without our knowledge. Perhaps we're heading towards a future where we might have no choice but to engage in some sort of conflict."" Rintaro Nishimura also warns that this hawkish stance could backfire in the long run. ""With a mandate, people expect her to be more hawkish on China. But prolonged tension could hurt the economy and that would hurt her approval."" Koichi Nakano warns that public debate about the China spat has all but disappeared. ""There is a general taboo in the media… sensible discussions about how to coexist with China can get easily branded as appeasement,"" he says. ""The real economic and security consequences of burning bridges with China are not really being discussed."" Sanae Takaichi is expected to visit Washington shortly after the elections to meet Donald Trump ahead of his summit with China's President Xi Jinping and amid Tokyo's very tense relationship with Beijing. ""Japan might get isolated without getting the support from Trump,"" Nakano warns, ""while it doesn't look anywhere near like a possibility that she'll be able to mend ties with Xi Jinping."" While concern over financial scandals appears to have faded, cost-of-living pressures remain front of mind. The sharp spike in rice prices in mid-2025 shocked households. Though it occurred before Takaichi took office, it continues to shape perceptions of the LDP. Inflation slowed in late 2025, but wages remain stagnant and the yen has weakened further. ""I used to spend about 10,000 yen ($64; £47) a week on groceries,"" Kanako Himura says. ""Now it's always more. Prices are rising, quantities are shrinking. Even when the price stays the same, you get less."" ""Tokyo property prices are too high,"" says Kento Naka, a 35-year-old manga artist. ""Paper books cost about one-and-a-half times more now. Everything else too. But income hasn't caught up at all."" Takaichi has promised public spending, inflation relief and tax cuts, but critics say the details remain vague. ""The reality is the cost of living is probably going to keep going up, and salaries are going to remain low… and that's one of the reasons why Takaichi is calling this early election,"" Hall said. ""She's probably figured out the economy is not going to be an easy fix. If she waits longer, people will start blaming her for the economy, as they blamed previous prime ministers."" Other long-held priorities have also faded from her campaign, including weapons exports, an anti-espionage law and immigration reform. This tactic, observers say, is less about policy and more about keeping her high position in the polls. Despite a newly formed centrist alliance between the Constitutional Democratic Party and former LDP coalition partner Komeito, polls suggest the opposition remains fragmented. ""The Komeito vote had been propping up the LDP for years,"" Jeffrey Hall says. ""Now the LDP is propping itself up using the popularity of the prime minister."" Rintaro Nishimura says the election has been framed as a choice between certainty and the unknown. ""There's not a lot of precedent for an opposition-led government,"" he says. ""That's always in the back of voters' minds."" The far-right Sanseito party has sharpened debate on immigration, but Jeffrey Hall says Takaichi's rise has blunted its momentum. ""One of the reasons the LDP picked Takaichi is that she is a hard-line conservative,"" he says. ""They were hoping she would draw nationalists back from Sanseito."" But the prime minister faces a tough act balancing an ageing society reluctant to receive immigrants and an economy that would not sustain without them. ""Japan has a major labour shortage. Foreign workers are now vital to many sectors of the economy,"" he says. ""If she doesn't want the economy to get worse, she will continue increasing immigration."" The dark cloud of the economy will hover over whoever takes office. If the prime minister does secure a majority, the stagnant wages, the weak yen and cost of living will be her most immediate and biggest challenges. ""There will be at least a brief honeymoon period,"" Koichi Nakano says. ""But the reality of the economy will hit very quickly."" It is rare for US presidents to publicly back candidates in foreign elections. ""Overtourism"" during Japan's iconic blossom season makes life for locals in Fujiyoshida town unmanageable, authorities say. The 22-year-old became caught in a chairlift and was suspended in midair before having a heart attack, officials say. Sir Keir and Sanae Takaichi discussed ways to strengthen ties between their two nations during the meeting, at the end of the UK prime minister's trip to East Asia. The event, advertised through official channels, was criticised in China for being held at a military memorial."
15,BBC,US police investigating new message in search for mother of Savannah Guthrie,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2e1e7nlegko,"Police are investigating a new message sent to a local TV news station that might be linked to the suspected abduction of the mother of US news presenter Savannah Guthrie. Authorities on Friday said they were ""aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie"". They are ""inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy"". The new development comes amid public pleas from the Guthrie family for proof that their mother is still alive and after the first deadline in one of the alleged ransom letters passed on Thursday evening. The 84-year-old is believed to have been taken from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend. Police are offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information. The statement from the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff's Department did not specify who received the note, or any details that it may have contained. A presenter for a local affiliate of CBS News told the BBC that her channel received the ""message"". It is unclear if it was sent to other media outlets. On Thursday, Camron Guthrie - the son of the missing woman - renewed the family's plea, and confirmed that the family had not had any direct contact with kidnappers. ""We have to know that you have our mum,"" Camron said in the family's latest video message. ""We want to talk to you."" ""We haven't heard anything directly,"" he said in the video, posted on Thursday just after 17:00 local time in Arizona (00:00 GMT). ""We need you to reach out, and we need a way to communicate with you so we can move forward."" The case has mystified the country and even US President Donald Trump has weighed in, ordering federal authorities to help investigate. On Friday, Trump said authorities had uncovered ""some clues"" and added that ""we could have some answers"" soon in the case. The new message is one of several that authorities say they are investigating. At a briefing on Thursday, FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing one of the notes, which he called a possible ransom note. It gave a deadline for payment of 17:00 on Thursday, he said, without specifying which time zone, and had a second deadline for Monday. No further information was shared about what was threatened if the deadline was not met. ""We're not going to go into specifics,"" Janke said. It was announced the same day that authorities had made an arrest over a fake ransom note. Earlier in the week, Savannah Guthrie shared an emotional video message, along with her siblings. The host of NBC News' Today programme addressed the potential abductor or abductors directly, saying: ""We are ready to talk... We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her... Please, reach out to us"". Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Thursday investigators were no closer to finding out who was responsible - but that they were working on the assumption she was still alive. ""Right now, we believe Nancy is still out there. We want her home,"" he said. ""Everybody's still a suspect in our eyes."" Dozens of reporters and camera crews have descended on the quiet Arizona suburb where Nancy lives. Authorities have closed access to her street, nestled below the Santa Catalina mountains on roads lined with the state's iconic Saguaro cactus. ""Investigators are conducting follow-up at the Guthrie home and in the surrounding areas,"" police wrote in a post on X, adding that the road is ""restricted to provide investigators space"". One man, when asked how he felt about security, shouted that he had already been interviewed four times today and wasn't doing any more. He then showed us a big stick, saying this is all the security he needs. He added he was not worried about kidnappers but he was worried about javelina, the hoofed mammals found in Tucson. Authorities have urged the public to call the sheriff's office with any information, vowing to look into all leads, and discouraging the spread of misinformation. The BBC's Regan Morris is in Tucson, Arizona, where 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home almost one week ago. Nancy Guthrie's family post their second video message this week appealing for the 84-year-old's release. Police have offered a reward of $50,000 for information on the disappearance, while the FBI says it is reviewing two ransom notes. The family of Ali Durrani are issuing a renewed appeal, with a £10,000 reward for information. Lorraine Ridout went missing in January 2016, prompting one of the largest police searches Cardiff had seen."

17,BBC,The retired Indian factory worker who built a library of two million books,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp873z18028o,"Two million books, housed across a sprawling building, free for anyone to borrow and read. That's the wealth that Anke Gowda, a retired sugar factory worker from India's southern Karnataka state, has accumulated over the past five decades. The 79-year-old made headlines last month when he received the Padma Shri - a civilian honour awarded by the federal government - for his extraordinary contribution to promoting literacy and learning. Gowda - whose eye-popping collection includes rare editions of the Bible, along with books on every subject imaginable - comes from a farming family where books were a luxury. ""I grew up in a village. We never got books to read, but I was always curious about them. I kept thinking that I should read, gather books and gain knowledge,"" he told the BBC. Gowda's library is located in Pandavapura, a small municipality in Karnataka's Mandya district. It lacks the rigid organisation usually associated with libraries. In fact, Gowda's collection doesn't have a librarian and books are stacked on shelves and piled on the floor in a haphazard manner. Outside, under the library's awnings are sacks filled with an estimated 800,000 books, still waiting to be unpacked. The collection is still growing, through Gowda's purchases and donations from others. The place is frequented by students, their parents, teachers and book lovers. Regular visitors seem to know their way around the library and find the books they need with ease. And even if they can't, they say, Gowda can find anything. Gowda, his wife and son live in a corner of the library, which is open every day of the week - and for long hours. Gowda spent his childhood juggling school and helping his father with farm work. He would often ask his parents and elder sister for money to buy books. When he began reading books about Indian freedom fighters and spiritual leaders, he got hooked. ""They were like candy,"" he says. Inspired by a teacher, he started building a small collection of books so that other students from rural areas could also read. He often used the money his parents gave him for food to buy books instead. Soon after finishing school, he started working as a bus conductor. One day, about 10 months into the job, he bumped into a former teacher who was shocked to hear that he had quit studying. He insisted that Gowda resign and go to college. Gowda followed his advice and went on to get a postgraduate degree in Kannada (the official language of Karnataka), before joining the Pandavapura sugar factory as a timekeeper. He would spend two-thirds of his monthly salary on books, and use the remaining money for groceries and other necessities. ""Salaries were low then, but prices were also low,"" he says. Over the 33 years he worked at the factory, Gowda attended dozens of conferences of the Kannada Sahitya Parishat - a non-profit dedicated to developing the local language and literature - and would often buy discounted books from them. He also augmented his income by raising cows and selling milk, and working as an insurance agent. His next hurdle would be familiar to book lovers everywhere - finding space to house his overflowing collection. ""I started keeping the books in trunks [large metal boxes]. Then I installed bookshelves in my house. But at one point, there was no place left,"" he says. At the time, he had acquired around 50,000 books. Help came when some of his friends met Hari Khoday, the late liquor baron who was building a temple in Pandavapura. Khoday, recalls Gowda, couldn't believe that one man could own so many books. ""He came and saw the books for himself. Then he asked me what I needed. I told him I didn't want any money for myself. My only request was that he build a library,"" Gowda says. Khoday agreed and paid for the construction of a huge building, which is now part of Gowda's sprawling library which stretches across 15,800 sq ft (1,467 sq m). Some years later, a local lawmaker brought then Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to see the library and he authorised money for the construction of two more structures attached to the first one. Today, students and teachers from across the state visit the library. Among them is Ravi Bettaswami, an assistant professor at a private college who says that he has also been inspired to build a collection of thousands of books. ""I have used Gowda's library to study and have taken my students there so they could read and also help organise the books,"" he says. Shilpashree Haranu, who teaches at a government college, says that the collection may look messy as it has not been organised by a professional librarian. ""But he [Gowda] knows exactly where each book is and can tell you in an instant,"" she says. When asked why he never hired a librarian, Gowda says no-one ever suggested that to him. As for the future of the library, Gowda strikes a philosophical note, suggesting that it is now up to others to take his legacy forward. ""I have fulfilled my responsibility. But I don't have the energy anymore. Maybe the government and the public can take over now? ""I have done my best, now it is up to others.""

18,BBC,MPs are shocked and angry at Mandelson - but they're furious with Starmer,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czej4ep882ko,"It's only six weeks since a smiling Sir Keir Starmer told us: ""I'll be sitting in this seat by 2027"" in his interview to mark the start of the year. The bald truth now? It is hard to find anyone in Labour who convincingly agrees. The prime minister is not responsible for Peter Mandelson's behaviour. But it was his decision to take a chance on him. Being furious now doesn't erase the initial choice, and each seedy email makes it seem a bigger and bigger mistake. Yes, MPs are shocked and angry with Peter Mandelson. But they are also angry with the prime minister. The real problem for Keir Starmer is that the fury this week is both a proxy, and a prompt, for stoking months of simmering unhappiness about the government. And it's spread far beyond the chorus of usual critics, making the PM's vow to be in the chair this time next year seem like a lifetime ago. Talking to MPs, ministers and party backers, it's just getting more and more common to hear the weary conclusion that Starmer will later, or sooner perhaps, have to go. One influential figure who has backed him told me that ""up until this point I would not have pushed for it, but I don't think there is any choice now – I can't see how his authority survives this"". The mess has left one usually loyal minister to conclude: ""I don't think anyone thinks he will actually still be PM in 2027."" There are still voices in government who reckon they can keep their heads down and stick it out. ""If he doesn't, then we are stuck in the same chaos... the UK becomes like Man U, we can't keep hold of a manager,"" a minister warns. But another senior figure says ""more than ever people feel now he is going to have to go"". A dangerous consensus has emerged for Keir Starmer that he is on the way out, an impression that is hard to remove. Inside government, the level of frustration over what's happened in the past few days is acute, again. That's not just because of Peter Mandelson's behaviour, which has been met with a genuine sense of betrayal and disbelief by his former colleagues. But because what happened follows a pattern that is all too familiar in Starmer's government. As a government source describes it, ""the perennial problem is getting to the right position far too slowly. Then, you get absolutely no credit, because it looks like you have been forced there."" The prime minister obviously believes now that it was wrong to hire Mandelson. There were plenty of people inside the Labour Party who always thought it was a mistake. But he only sacked him in September, when information emerged gradually and political pressure made it supremely uncomfortable. The government is now vowing to publish communications between Mandelson and his colleagues. But it was only pushed into doing so by the opposition, and the prospect of being abandoned by its own MPs, who made it clear that they were never going to vote to block such publication. That embarrassment took up most of Wednesday, even though some Labour ministers had already suggested the idea of publishing the documents on Tuesday night, including getting the Intelligence Committee to handle the process. Starmer's government allies hope and believe the documents will show that Mandelson lied and the PM did nothing wrong. But even if the documents, possibly as many as 100,000 show that, a separate government source says this is yet another example of trying to right a wrong, far too slowly. ""It will be Starmerism in a nutshell – an extraordinarily painful route to complete exoneration,"" they said. Whether it's this week's fiasco, or the decision on winter fuel allowance, or lifting the cap on bigger families getting some benefits, there's deep frustration in government more broadly that so much of what it has spent time doing is reversing its own positions. The polls suggest voters don't give much credit to politicians for undoing what many of their own MPs and members would consider mistakes they've made themselves. ""Vote for me, I'll get it right in the end"" is not a winning formula. Starmer's position is protected right now by the fact that none of his possible contenders seem to be displaying an immediate hunger for the job. One minister told me everything's ""weirdly stuck, in limbo"". Wes Streeting, the health secretary, has made little secret of his ambition for the job but he's held back not just because of his own friendship with Mandelson, which makes this an awkward moment for him, even though his fury at the former Labour peer is plain. But the political truth is the first challenger rarely becomes the champion. Frankly, if Streeting had wanted to go first, he'd probably have made a move already. The other obvious candidate, who played a major role in pushing the government on publication of its communications with Mandelson, is the former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner. But the tangled investigation into her tax affairs over buying a £800,000 property on the Sussex coast has not yet come to an end. Until that's over, it's not easy for her to make a move. And Andy Burnham? Well, remember the PM's allies blocked the chance for him to come back as an MP two weeks ago. Unless an unexpected candidate decides to take the plunge, and goodness knows what could happen these days, a change at the top doesn't seem likely to be prompted by the wannabe contenders. That is a comfort for Starmer's allies. But keeping your job because there's no automatic, tasty replacement is a position of safety built on others' weakness, not your own strength. Aside from the swirl around Starmer's leadership, many MPs and members of the public are just thoroughly sickened by the revelations. Epstein's victims are the ones who hurt the most. Mandelson's seeming closeness to Epstein has appalled Labour politicians of all generations – those for whom he's been an ally since the 1980s, or younger MPs who have benefited from his patronage. There is also an obvious sense of vindication from others, who objected to his influence for years, as one minister told me yesterday – ""I've always hated him and he's always hated me"". MPs hope it might prompt a change in how politics is done, questioning a ""culture that has an acceptance of what power does to people"". But while the revelations continue, there is deep unease. ""It's like the beginning of the expenses scandal, or the financial crash – no one knows where it will end, or who it might take down next,"" says a cabinet minister. And it's exacerbated the level of doom in Labour's ranks about the prospects for Keir Starmer, stuck in limbo, as one MP told me, ""we're just beside ourselves that we can't get anything done or sorted because of it all - everything is being held up by people wondering if they're going to have to run a leadership contest"". You can hear that frustration in ministers' voices – on Tuesday, the government had voted to get rid of the limit on bigger families getting some benefits – it took months to persuade No 10 to make that expensive move which cheered the backbenches. The following day any sign of that feeling of accomplishment vanished. The risk for the country, which elected Labour less than two years ago with an enormous majority, is that the PM's predicament means the governing party is distracted. Unable to go back and start again, unable to go forward boldly, because the position of its leader is in such peril. ""The government just can't govern with direction – that's a massive issue, and something is going to have to give,"" one senior official told me. Politics in the 2020s change fast, and it is daft to try to predict what could happen next. It is, of course, still possible that something will turn up. That the prime minister can turn things around, as one of his exasperated cabinet allies said, ""people just really want us to fix it"". But the Mandelson mess makes mending what's been done that much harder. Back in January, Starmer vowed to be in the chair in 2027. He also said he'd be judged at the General Election in 2029. But as the shock waves from this latest scandal hit, the truth is that so many people in his party have reached a judgement already - that he may not be the man to get them that far.

19,BBC,Ukrainian mother's joy after phone call with son she thought had been killed,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cedwdljyx46o,"Nazar Daletskyi's family were sure the soldier had been killed in action. In 2023, they'd buried his body in the village cemetery, in western Ukraine. But Nazar has just phoned his mother, weakened and exhausted - but very much alive. He's been released from Russian captivity in the latest prisoner swap. ""My emotions were so strong,"" the soldier's mother Nataliya told the BBC, still reeling from the shock. The joy of all the family at that first call, captured on video, is overwhelming. Nataliya asks her son whether he's intact, ""You have your arms, your legs, everything?"" she wants to know. ""My golden child, I have been waiting for you so long."" Nazar's cousin, Roksolana, is screaming and jumping for joy in the background. ""It was so strange, because my son had died, I buried him, but here's his voice. Can you imagine the emotions of a mother? Happiness. Great happiness. I could not hold back my tears,"" Nataliya said. The full story of Nazar's return from the grave is extraordinary, especially in a country at war where good news is precious. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, Nazar - who was 42 then - went straight back to the front: he'd already fought in 2014, so he was experienced. ""He didn't have any doubt. He went immediately,"" his cousin told the BBC. But in May that first year, Nazar went missing in action. His mother then got a call from a man speaking Russian who said Nazar had been captured, but ""everything will be fine"". The mystery voice didn't say where Nazar was, who was holding him - or whether he was injured. The family had no idea whether to believe him - and they got no official news. That was until a year later, when Nataliya was informed that a body had been identified in a morgue in south-eastern Ukraine, using a sample of DNA she had given. ""The body was badly burned. They had several that they found in a burned bus. When they started looking at the lists of missing soldiers, the data matched,"" Roksolana explains. ""They identified this body as Nazar."" So the family received the body, held a funeral and they grieved. Then last September they got the biggest shock of all. A soldier, just released by Russia, called to tell them Nazar was alive. He had seen him in jail. ""We were shocked, it was so hard to believe. But why would he lie?"" Roksolana remembers how it felt. Still, without speaking to Nazar or seeing him, they couldn't be sure. Then this week, he called - back on Ukrainian soil. Nataliya's son had been gone for three years and nine months. As they wait for their big reunion, the family have been trying to remove material about Nazar's funeral from social media, not to upset him. They also had to get his photograph taken down from a display of fallen heroes in the village. There's now an investigation to understand how such a distressing mistake was made. But for the moment, the family have other things to focus on. Nazar's mother is preparing all his favourite homemade food, for when he's recovered a bit and ready to come home. ""I just want more positive outcomes like ours, for other families to get calls and for people to come home,"" Roksolana says. Some 70,000 people are officially missing here, most thought to be soldiers. Some will have been killed on the battlefield, their bodies impossible to recover. But many have been taken prisoner and, for their families, Nazar's story will be a glimmer of hope. ""I wish all women, mothers, children get a call like we had - and this happiness,"" Nataliya says. ""I'm just waiting for my son now, to hug him so tightly. I love him very much."" Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev is a senior figure in the main directorate of Russia's military general staff. Nazar Daletskyi's relatives were told he had been killed in 2022, the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion. Russia editor Steve Rosenberg reports from the outskirts of the Russian capital, where Lt Gen Vladimir Alexeyev was shot and wounded. A donation of five vehicles to the Ukrainian war effort is welcomed after arriving from the UK. The expiration of New START means there are no limits on nuclear weapons between both countries for the first time since 1991."

These largely anonymous figures, exposed in the most visceral way, illustrated medical atlases that were once consulted by doctors and anatomists or displayed like trophies by wealthy collectors. And like Adriaan Adriaanszoon, the petty thief painted by Rembrandt, none of them consented to images of their unclothed, mutilated bodies being bound up in a book or displayed on a wall. ""Beneath the Sheets challenges visitors to question whose bodies feature in anatomical textbooks, who was drawing them, and why,"" Jamie Taylor, the museum’s director of collections, learning and programming tells the BBC. ""The bodies depicted in these pages belong to people who throughout history have been repressed, whose rights have been considered secondary, negligible, or ignored."" An anatomy book without drawings is ""no better than a book of geography without its maps"", declared 18th-Century surgeon and anatomical illustrator John Bell. His intricate, cross-hatched engravings disseminated a detailed knowledge of the body that few had seen outside an anatomy theatre. But a closer look at such illustrations uncovers not just our changing understanding of the human body but also the cultural context in which these images were created. Particularly revealing, and shown early on in the exhibition, is the elaborate title page of Andreas Vesalius's book De Humani Corporis Fabrica (1543), the first major text to show human anatomy drawn directly from dissected bodies. In a crowded anatomy theatre, the author, ever the showman, performs a dissection on an executed sex worker − his scalpel revealing to a predominantly male audience if the woman was pregnant, as she had professed in her plea for clemency. The difference in social standing and power between surgeon and subject could hardly be starker, and the market for these intricately illustrated books was, the exhibition notes, ""at the opposite end of the economic spectrum to the people depicted within their pages"". Medical books became especially lavish when developments in lithography in the 19th Century flooded their pages with vivid colour. The museum's edition of JM Bourgery's sumptuously illustrated Complete Atlas of Human Anatomy and Surgery (1866) has barely been touched, Dr Jack Gann, the exhibition's curator, tells the BBC. Those who could afford such works, he says, ""would have displayed them in their homes along with their art collections"". Sometimes the cadaver itself became an object of art for display. The lack of agency many women had over what happened to their bodies after death, and the sinister role that some respected medical practitioners played in this, is exemplified in the case of Mary Billion. She died in 1775 and was embalmed by her dentist husband Martin van Butchell, assisted by the esteemed London surgeon William Hunter, his former teacher and the author of an illustrated book of pregnant bodies lauded for its unprecedented realism. Hoping to lure new clients, Van Butchell dressed Billion in her wedding gown and exhibited her in the window of his Mayfair dental practice and home until his second wife insisted the body be moved to a museum. Art and anatomical science have a long kinship. In Renaissance Italy, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo made studies of dissected bodies in mortuaries to help them make the figures in their paintings more realistic, while early anatomical atlases depicted bodies in stylised poses reminiscent of Classical sculpture. William Cheselden's The Anatomy of the Human Body (1741), for example, includes two skinless figures wrestling like Hercules and Antaeus. For scientists and artists alike, the biggest challenge was access to bodies, exacerbated by the 1823 Judgement of Death Act, which reduced the number of crimes punishable by death. A lucrative black market for cadavers emerged, with bodysnatchers, nicknamed ""resurrection men"", stealing corpses from fresh graves and selling them to medical schools for princely sums. To thwart them, those who could afford to buried their loved ones in cages known as ""mortsafes"", or had heavy stones laid over their burial site. For convicted criminals and the poor, resting in peace was more uncertain. Relatives of the highwayman John Worthington, executed in 1815, took the extraordinary step of dousing his body in acid to ensure it was unfit for dissection. William Hare and William Burke became Scotland's most notorious serial killers. They looked to the living rather than the dead, conducting a 10-month murder campaign between 1827 and 1828 in order to supply the Edinburgh anatomy school of Dr Robert Knox with corpses. Mary Paterson, a former inmate of an asylum for ""fallen"" women, whose dead body was suspiciously warm on arrival, was intoxicated with whisky by her assailants before being preserved in it for three months by Knox. The law eventually caught up with her killers. Though Hare was freed in return for evidence, his accomplice was less fortunate. Lord Justice-Clerk David Boyle sentenced him to death by hanging, and pronounced that Burke, like his victims, be ""publicly dissected and anatomised"". His skeleton now hangs in the University of Edinburgh's Anatomical Museum. At the Thackray Museum of Medicine, Paterson's body is also on display, but as a drawing – the ethics of which were vigorously debated by the curatorial team. She's drawn like Velázquez's Rokeby Venus, points out Gann. ""It is a very sensual image"", but it is also, he says, ""the dead body of a murder victim who has continued to be exploited"". Idealised physiques dominate these medical books, blurring the boundaries between science, art and erotica, and offering insights into the preferences and preoccupations of their creators. In one of Nicolas Henri Jacob's most haptic illustrations for Bourgery, scientific detachment is called into question as two pairs of disembodied male hands probe the dissected breast of a young woman whose hair has been styled like an Ancient Greek beauty. ""Anatomical illustrations gave off heat, provided pleasure to the men who produced, gazed upon, and studied them,"" argues Michael Sappol in Queer Anatomies (2024). For surgeon and artist Joseph Maclise, that ""gaze"" was queer, contends Sappol. Maclise's landmark work Surgical Anatomy (1851) is dominated by men in ambiguous poses: their muscular arms raised submissively behind their head, for example, or their mouth parted in a way that could be read as pleasure. It's possible, proposes Sappol in a 2021 essay, ""that Maclise's renderings, in some queer and occluded fashion – maybe not even fully apparent to Maclise himself… were a space in which he unveiled himself, sent out flares of homoerotic desire"". ""People perceive that an anatomical illustration is an objective depiction of the human body to the best of the artist’s abilities,"" says Gann, which is something that the exhibition seeks to ""break apart"". ""In truth, they are subject to culture and tastes and artistic movements as any other form of art and illustration."" A nameless black figure in Maclise's book, thought to be the only black body in anatomical works of the period, is a case in point, having been removed from the edition created for pre-abolition America. His depiction, notes Keren Rosa Hammerschlag in her 2021 essay, Black Apollo: Aesthetics, Dissection, and Race in Joseph Maclise's Surgical Anatomy, is ""notably aestheticised, placing him in dialogue with classical statues such as the Apollo Belvedere, the ""high"" art productions of Joseph’s brother Daniel Maclise, pictures of black pugilists, and abolitionist imagery from the period."" Within a decade of Maclise, Henry Gray's celebrated Gray's Anatomy, illustrated by Henry Vandyke Carter, would finally place an affordable resource in the hands of medical students, yet it too was indebted to unclaimed bodies from workhouses and infirmaries. ""There is a silence at the centre of Gray's, as indeed there is in all anatomy books, which relates to the unutterable,"" writes Ruth Richardson in The Making of Mr Gray's Anatomy. ""As mass-produced images, [the bodies of these people] have entered the brains of generations of the living... And nowhere but in Carter's images do they receive memorial."" The use of voiceless victims to further medical science endured into the 20th Century. Eduard Pernkopf's Atlas of Topographical and Applied Human Anatomy (1937), for example, still used by some surgeons today, features prisoners of war dissected by Nazi doctors working under Hitler's regime. Sixty years later, on the eve of the millennium, a digital archive of the entire human body, created by The Visible Human Project, was published in The New Atlas of Human Anatomy by Thomas McCracken. The 3D images were formed from hundreds of one-millimetre slices of the body of Joseph Paul Jernigan, a Texan murderer executed by lethal injection in 1993. Though he had agreed to donate his body to medical science, he could never have foreseen such a visible future for it. ""This is an enormous dataset still available for people to use today,"" says Gann, who concludes the exhibition with the question: ""How far have we really come?"" Beneath the Sheets: Anatomy, Art and Power is at the Thackray Museum of Medicine, Leeds, UK,  from 7 February to 21 June. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

29,BBC,An ancient trick to think more wisely,https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20230411-illeism-the-ancient-trick-to-help-you-think-more-wisely,"It’s hard to reason through problems, but there are ways to be more objective and less biased in your thinking. As a writer specialising in psychology, I’ve come across hundreds of evidence-based tips for better thinking. Few have proven as useful to me as the ancient strategy of illeism. Put simply, illeism is the practice of talking about oneself in the third person, rather than the first person. The rhetorical device is often used by politicians to try to give their words an air of objectivity. In his account of the Gallic War, for example, the emperor Julius Caesar wrote “Caesar avenged the public” rather than “I avenged the public”. The small linguistic switch seems intended to make the statement feel a little more like historical fact, recorded by an impartial observer To the modern ear, illeism can sound a little silly or pompous – and we may even deride famous people who choose to talk in this way. Yet recent psychological research suggests that illeism can bring some real cognitive benefits. If we are trying to make a difficult decision, speaking about ourselves in the third person can help to neutralise the emotions that could lead our thinking astray, allowing us to find a wiser solution to our problem. Solomon’s paradox To understand these benefits of illeism, we must first examine the ways that scientists measure the wisdom of someone’s reasoning. The scientific study of wisdom has been spear-headed by Igor Grossmann at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Grossmann first drew on the work of numerous philosophers to decide on a series of “metacognitive components” – including intellectual humility, acknowledgement of others’ viewpoints and search for compromise – that are commonly considered to be essential for wise decision making. In one of his first studies, Grossmann asked participants to think out loud about their responses to various dilemmas – such as personal problems posed to the Dear Abby “agony aunt” column – while independent psychologists rated their spoken responses according to these criteria. Grossmann found that these tests of wise reasoning were better than IQ tests at predicting people’s overall life satisfaction and the quality of their social relationships. This suggested the studies were capturing something unique about their reasoning skills. Grossmann’s later studies revealed that the wisdom of people’s reasoning can depend on the context. In particular, he found that their wise reasoning scores tended to be much higher when considering other people’s situations than their own personal dilemmas. Grossmann called this “Solomon’s Paradox” after the ancient Biblical king, who was famous for advising others wisely, while making a series of disastrous personal decisions that ultimately left his kingdom in chaos. The problem seems to be that when making personal choices, we become too immersed in our emotions, which cloud our thinking and prevent us from putting our issues in perspective. If I have received negative feedback from a colleague, for example, my feeling of embarrassment might lead me to become overly self-defensive. I might therefore dismiss their opinions without considering whether their advice could be helpful in the long-term. How to be wise Could illeism resolve Solomon’s paradox? The idea makes intuitive sense: by switching to the third person, our descriptions of the situation will start to sound as if we are talking about someone else rather than ourselves. This sense of detachment would allow us to see the bigger picture, rather than getting caught up in our own feelings. And that is exactly what Grossmann found in a study with Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. They showed that people employing illeism to talk about their problems showed greater intellectual humility, capacity to recognise others’ perspectives, and willingness to reach compromise – increasing their overall wise reasoning scores. The latest studies show that the regular use of illeism can bring about lasting benefits to our thinking. Working with Abigail Sholer, Anna Dorfman and colleagues, Grossmann asked participants to keep a daily diary for one month in which they described a situation they had just experienced. Half were told to write their entries in the third person, while the other half were told to write in the first person. At the start and end of the study, the team also tested the subjects’ general wise reasoning. As hoped, the researchers found that, over the course of the intervention, the participants who had been encouraged to use illeism in their diaries saw a rise in their wise-reasoning scores over the course of the month. By encouraging us to put our problems in perspective, the use of illeism may also help us to have a more balanced response to daily stresses. People who had completed the diary in the third person reported more positive emotions after challenging events, rather than dwelling solely on the sadness, frustration or disappointment. Based on these findings, I now apply illeism to all decisions, small and big. Whether I’m facing trials at work, conflict with my friends, or strife in the family, I find that a few moments contemplating my problems from a third-person perspective helps me to see the issue more clearly.

30,BBC,What's the best time of the day to exercise?,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240105-whats-the-best-time-of-the-day-to-exercise,"There is growing evidence that the time of day we exercise makes a difference to our performance and health, but can we train our bodies to peak at different times of the day? In a few months, the world's top athletes will gather in Paris to compete for the ultimate prize in sport – gold at the Olympic Games. For those hoping for a chance to enter the history books with a record-breaking performance, they might want to look at the hour on the clock before they settle into the starting blocks. At least the swimmers might, according to one scientific study. Across four Olympic Games in Athens (2004), Beijing (2008), London (2012) and Rio (2016), the swim times of 144 medal-winning swimmers were found to be the fastest if they were competing in the early evening. Specifically, around 5:12pm. It is part of a growing amount of evidence suggesting that physical performance is affected by the time-of-day. The phenomena is not just found among decorated Olympians – recreational cyclists complete faster time trials in the evening. Resistance exercise is particularly susceptible to time-of-day effects, with performance nearly always peaking between 4pm and 8pm. The time-of-day seems to also lead to affect men and women differently when they exercise. But what if your schedule means you only have time to exercise at 7am? There are some indications it may even be possible to adjust your peak time for athletic performance. At the root of the differences in how our bodies perform and respond to exercise are our circadian rhythms – the body's molecular clock responsible for regulating behaviours such as sleep and appetite throughout the 24-hour period. A central clock located in the hypothalamus of the brain responds to light exposure via signals from the optic nerve. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, as this circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamus is known, in turn sends signals to peripheral clocks in other organs, muscle tissue and fat tissue, keeping the whole body in sync. These peripheral clocks, however, can be adjusted by other cues such as when we eat or perform certain activities. The ""skeletal muscle clock"" responds in this way to exercise, and so can be tuned by exercising regularly at different times. But while this can affect performance, it can also alter the effect exercise has on our health, too. Juleen Zierath, an exercise physiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, has been researching the interaction between exercise and the circadian system. She and her colleagues found mice that exercised in the morning burn more fat. Zierath says the findings suggest that exercising at an optimal time-of-day could maximise the health benefits of exercise for individuals with metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. ""Everybody agrees that exercise is good, irrespective of time-of-day, but one can maybe fine-tune the metabolic outcomes of the exercise based on when you exercise,"" says Zierath. Their findings reflect a recent study in humans that showed performing an exercise regime of resistance training, interval sprints, stretching and endurance for an hour one day a week in the morning can reduce abdominal fat and blood pressure in women. Interestingly, when women did the same exercises in the evening, it enhanced their muscular performance. For men, evening exercise helped to lower blood pressure and stimulates the breakdown of body fat. But research in this area is still evolving and some recent analyses of previous studies suggests the evidence is somewhat inconclusive for an advantageous time-of-day effect upon exercise performance or health benefits. One reason for this is almost certainly the differences that exist between individuals. For example, the time of peak athletic performance differs among individuals with early chronotypes and individuals with late chronotypes, also known as morning larks and night owls. ""There are variations in the timing of our clocks,"" says Karyn Esser, a physiologist at the University of Florida in Gainesville in the US. ""Those of us that are larks have a clock that likely runs a little bit less than 24 hours, and those of us that are owls probably have a clock that runs a little bit more than 24 hours."" But if you find your own circadian rhythms don't quite allow you to give your best performance at the times you have available, exercise may also help to ""reset"" your muscle clock. You might also like:  A group of researchers led by Esser, found that consistent endurance running training among mice in the morning can cause the rodent's bodies to adapt to the new exercise regime. The exercise appears to shift the molecular clocks in their skeletal muscle and lung tissues to an earlier time-of-day. The team's latest study, which has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, found that the magnitude of adaption in performance was greater in mice trained in the morning, compared to those trained in the afternoon. After six weeks of training, both morning and afternoon mice achieved the same maximum endurance performance. The researchers suggest that if a similar effect is found in humans, it might be possible for athletes to recalibrate their internal ""muscle clocks"" with the right training. There is some preliminary evidence that exercise can shift circadian rhythms in humans, making it perhaps useful for those adjusting to shift work or jet lag. ""The simple notion here is that the clocks in our muscles are actually paying attention to when we train,"" says Esser. Routine appears to be key – our body adapts better to training when it is performed regularly at the same time of day. ""If you're in the general population, or even an elite athlete, and you plan to compete, you should try to have a race-day-specific training,"" says Zierath. ""Time your training bouts so that they are consistent with the time that you're going to have to be performing or competing at your peak."" Most researchers are keen to point out, however, that exercising at any time is beneficial. But, if do you find a time that works and stick with it, your body may just adapt to give you an extra edge. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news delivered to your inbox every Friday.

31,BBC,The truth about salt in your diet,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20181029-eating-less-salt-benefits,"Some scientists argue that a low-salt diet is just as dangerous as high salt consumption. What's the reality? In 2017, Turkish chef Nusret Gökçe went viral after a video lovingly seasoning a massive steak with a pinch of salt amassed millions of views online and earned him the nickname ""salt bae"". But it wasn't just his attention to detail that captured attention. We're obsessed with salt – despite warnings, almost every population around the world consumes almost twice as much as they should be and its harming our health in the process. But a counter-argument is gaining ground, casting doubt on decades of research and shedding light on the questions that still remain unanswered about our favourite seasoning. Sodium, the key element found in salt, is essential for our bodies to maintain its overall fluid balance, transport oxygen and nutrients. It allows our nerves to pulse with electricity. But most populations have historically eaten more salt than advised and health officials around the world have had their work cut out for them convincing us to cut down. How much salt should you consume daily? The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends limiting sodium consumption to less than 2g per day, which is around 5g of sodium chloride salt. In the US, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends adults limit their intake to less than 2.3g of sodium per day, or about a teaspoon of salt. Researchers in a 2022 paper concluded that a moderate sodium consumption (between 3 and 6g per day) is best for reducing the risk of heart disease, compared to low and high-sodium diets.  Guidelines from the NHS in the UK recommend adults have no more than 6g of salt per day, including salt that's already in the food we buy and salt we add ourselves during or after cooking. In the UK, average salt consumption is closer to 8.4g per day while in the US it is 8.5g. Meanwhile the WHO estimates that average salt intake globally has risen to almost 10.8g per day. But only a quarter of our daily intake comes from salt we add into food ourselves – the rest is hidden in the food we buy, including bread, sauces, soups and some cereals. Adding to the confusion is that on food labels, manufacturers often refer to sodium content rather than salt, which can make us think we're consuming less salt than we are. Salt is made up of both sodium and chloride ions. In 2.5g of salt, there is about 1g of sodium. ""The general public isn't aware of this, and just think sodium and salt are the same thing. No one tells you this,"" says nutritionist May Simpkin. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about 40% of the sodium consumed by people in the US comes from foods including pizza, deli meat, burritos and tacos, savory snacks, poultry and burgers. Research has found that too much salt causes high blood pressure, which can lead to strokes and heart disease. Experts broadly agree that the evidence against salt is compelling. Our bodies retain water when we eat salt, increasing blood pressure until our kidneys flush it out. Too much salt over a long period of time can put strain on our arteries and lead to prolonged high blood pressure, known as hypertension, which causes 62% of all strokes and 49% of coronary heart disease events, according to the WHO. It estimates that excessive sodium intake is responsible for 1.89 million deaths globally every year. One meta-analysis of 13 studies published over 35 years found a 17% greater risk of total cardiovascular disease and a 23% greater risk of stroke from consuming an extra 5g of salt per day. As you might expect, cutting salt intake can have the reverse effect. In one eight-year data analysis from the Health Survey for England, researchers found that a decline in salt intake by 1.4g per day was likely to have contributed to a fall in blood pressure – which in turn contributed to the 42% decline in fatal strokes and 40% drop in heart disease-related deaths. A more recent clinical trial published in 2023 found that following a low-sodium diet for one week had a blood pressure-lowering effect comparable to a drug commonly given to patients with high blood pressure. However, researchers who've carried out observational studies often concluded that it's difficult to entirely separate the effects of eating less salt from other diet and lifestyle behaviours, since those who are more conscious of their salt intake are more likely to eat healthier overall, exercise more, smoke less and drink less. Long-term, randomised trials comparing people who eat a lot versus a little salt could establish cause and effect. But very few such studies exist because of the funding requirements and ethical implications. ""Randomised trials showing salt's effect on the body are almost impossible to carry out,"" says Francesco Cappuccio, professor of cardiovascular medicine and epidemiology at the University of Warwick's medical school and author of the eight-year review. ""But there are also no randomised trials for obesity, or smoking, which we know kills you."" Meanwhile, observational evidence is in abundance. After the Japanese government launched a campaign to persuade people to reduce their salt intake in the late 1960s, intake decreased from 13.5g to 12g per day. Over the same period there were falls in blood pressure and an 80% reduction in stroke mortality. In Finland, daily salt intake dropped from 12g in the late 1970s to as little as 9g by 2002, and there was a 75-80% decrease in deaths from stroke and heart disease in the same period. But an additional complicating factor is that the effects of salt consumption on blood pressure and heart health differ from one individual to another. Studies have found that our sensitivity to salt varies from person to person – depending on factors as varied as ethnicity, age, body mass index, health and family history of hypertension. Some studies have found that those with higher salt sensitivity are more at risk of salt-associated high blood pressure. In fact, some scientists controversially argue that a low-salt diet is just as much of a risk factor for developing high blood pressure as high salt consumption. In other words, they say there is a J- or U-shaped curve with a threshold at the bottom where risk starts to go back up. One meta-analysis, for example, pointed to a link between low salt intake and cardiovascular-related events and death. The researchers argued that consuming either less than 5.6g or more than 12.5g a day is associated with negative health outcomes. Another study, published in 2020, stated that strict restrictions of salt intake were associated with worse health in patients with heart failure, especially among younger and non-white people. A ""mini-review"" of the evidence published in 2022 also concluded that a moderate sodium consumption of 3-6g per day is best for reducing the risk of heart disease, compared to low and high-sodium diets. But these findings have been met with heavy criticism from the majority of researchers and public health bodies, who say the studies lack rigor and have flaws in the way salt intake is measured. They also point to conflicts of interest between the authors of some of these studies and the food industry, which could bias the results. This has not prevented such findings from making headlines around the world. One study of 130,000 people, published in the high profile medical journal, the Lancet, received widespread attention when it reported a link between ""low"" salt intake, defined as less than 7.5g, and increased risk of cardiovascular events and death in people both with and without hypertension, compared to a ""moderate"" intake of up to 12.5g per day (between 1.5 to 2.5 teaspoons of salt). That moderate intake is up to double the UK recommended daily intake. The study's lead author, Andrew Mente, a nutritional epidemiologist at McMaster University in Ontario, concluded that reducing salt intake from high to moderate reduces the risk of high blood pressure, but there are no health benefits beyond that. And increasing salt intake from low to moderate might help too. ""The finding of a sweet spot in the middle is consistent with what you would expect for any essential nutrient… where at high levels you have toxicity and at low levels you have deficiency,"" he says. ""An optimal level is always found somewhere in the middle."" But not everyone agrees, with several experts in public health and cardiovascular disease publishing detailed criticisms of Mente's research, casting doubt over the findings. Others have called for better trials of salt consumption to help resolve the issue. Cappuccio is unequivocal that a reduction in salt consumption reduces blood pressure in everyone – not just people who eat far too much. He says the wave of studies in recent years concluding contrary findings are small, include participants who are already unwell, and rely on flawed data. Mente's study, he says, used a fasting spot urine test on participants instead of the ""gold standard"" of spreading several tests over a 24-hour period. Sara Stanner, science director at the charity the British Nutrition Foundation, agrees the evidence that reducing salt intake in those with hypertension lowers blood pressure and risk of heart disease is strong. And there aren't many people consuming levels as low as 3g, the level at which some of this research calls dangerously low. This would be difficult to achieve, Stanner says, due to the levels of salt in foods we buy. ""So much of the salt we consume is in everyday foods,"" she says. ""This is why reformulation across the food supply chain is the most successful approach to cut down on national salt levels, as has been the case in the UK."" More like this: • We don’t need nearly as much protein as we consume • Is sugar really bad for you? • The truth about eating eggs Experts also have conflicting views on whether high salt intake can be offset by an otherwise healthy diet and exercise. Some, including Stanner, say that a diet rich in potassium, found in fruit, vegetables, nuts and dairy, can help to offset salt's adverse effects on blood pressure. Ceu Mateus, senior lecturer in Health Economics at Lancaster University, advises that we should prioritise being aware of hidden salt in our diets rather than trying to avoid it altogether. ""The problems we have with too much salt could be similar to those linked with too little, but we still need to do more research to understand what goes on here. In the meantime, a healthy person is going to be able to regulate small amounts,"" Mateus says. ""We should be aware that too much salt is really bad, but don't eliminate it completely from your diet."" Despite recent studies arguing the potential dangers of a low salt diet, and individual differences in salt sensitivity, the most established takeaway from existing research is that too much salt definitely increases blood pressure. Take the rest with a pinch of… well, you know. * This article was originally published on 30 October 2018. It was updated on 1 September 2025 to include recent research. It was also updated to clarify the controversy around studies examining the risk of low salt diets. A picture caption on an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that 100g of blue cheese contains as much salt as seawater.

32,BBC,"Fifty courses, no leftovers: Inside Italy's sacred Panarda feast",https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260203-inside-italys-sacred-panarda-feast,"Each year in the village of Villavallelonga, friends and family gather to honour a local saint with a 50-course meal where no forkful goes uneaten – just as they have for centuries. It's just past 23:00 when the pasta bignè (fried dough swimming in hen broth) is cleared away. The rustic soup is the 22nd course my fellow 42 diners and I have been served since taking our seats in Lucia Corona's dining room. Now comes the frascareglie – a humble ""false polenta"" made from water and flour and smothered with fragrant mutton ragu. We've been sitting at the table for three hours. There are 28 more courses to go. Dinners that last hours are typical in Italy, but this is no typical dinner.  This is the panarda, the communal meal held every 16 January on the feast of Saint Anthony Abate in the 900-person mountain village of Villavallelonga, Abruzzo. There are 50 button-popping courses, all to be eaten: no shortcuts, no excuses. It is one of the most distinctive communal food rituals in central Italy – and one of its oldest. Deep in the central Apennines, Villavallelonga is characterised by medieval stone houses and narrow stairways. It remains one of Italy's lesser touristed mountain villages. Perhaps this is why the week of Saint Anthony Abate – from 11 to 17 January – feels so much like stepping back in time. Plan your trip: When: The panarda takes place on 16 January during the feast of Saint Anthony Abate with events running from 11 to 17 January, including music, communal food and a masked procession marking the start of Carnival. Getting there: Villavallelonga is best reached from Rome by train to Avezzano or by rental car. From Avezzano, it's about 30 minutes by car; bus services are limited. Where to stay: Accommodation in Villavallelonga is scarce; base yourself in Avezzano or Celano, where hotels and B&Bs are more readily available. ""It matters more than Christmas, feels more immersive than Carnival and is louder than New Year's Eve,"" says Vittoria Di Ponzio, Villavallelonga's deputy mayor. ""For a week, the whole village takes part."" The first five days, the village comes alive at night. Fireworks crack through the dark. Families gather around outdoor fires, sharing dishes simmered in giant pots. Young adults roam the streets with accordions and drums, singing the canzone di Sant'Antonio (Saint Anthony's Song) in exchange for plates of fava beans and wine. On the evening of 17 January, the celebrations conclude in the main piazza with pasta all'amatriciana (pasta with tomato sauce and cured pig jowl) and the burning of the pupazze (towering ritual figures built over the preceding months made from wood, fabric and papier-mâché). ""It's the most intense week of the year,"" says local student Nicola Palozzi, between bites of sausages with chicory. ""We barely sleep, but we wouldn't miss it for anything."" He then sets his fork down, picks up his accordion and joins in the music. The earliest written records of the panarda date to 1657 and describe a ritual linked to the end of winter. At its core are two founding legends and two families. According to tradition, the custom began when the Serafini, local landowners, pledged to offer an abundant meal to the community if Saint Anthony Abate freed them from a pact with the devil. Another legend tells that it was the Bianchi family, instead, who vowed to distribute the favata – fava beans and bread – to the townspeople at dawn on 17 January, from house to house, after Saint Anthony saved a child taken by a wolf. ""But for us, panarda isn't folklore,"" says local official Constantina Ferrari. ""It's how we recognise ourselves. Even if you live elsewhere, this is where you feel you still belong."" At first, the panarda was offered only to the poorest villagers. Today, the guest list has evolved to include anyone who wishes to take part, but the rule remains unchanged: everyone at the dinner eats the same food, in the same order, at the same pace. ""Here, you don't choose to host it – you inherit it,"" says Corona, my panarda host, as she weaves between three long tables to serve course number 37: lamb cutlets with green salad. ""It's an honour, and you have to take it seriously."" While the descendants of the Serafini family host the official panarda, the same ritual dinner is held simultaneously in many other homes across the village. Guests also follow unwritten rules: every course must be eaten, and once you take part, you are expected to return year after year – always to the same panarda. ""There are no tickets, but our guiding principle is that no one should be left out,"" says Cristina Mastrella of the Villavallelonga Pro Loco organising committee. How do you get an invite? ""The Italian way,"" she says. ""Ask around. Someone will always find a place for you."" Here at the Corona home, Montepulciano and Pecorino wines are flowing steadily. Each hosting family follows its own menu, but some dishes are non-negotiable: antipasti of cured meats, cheeses, olives and fava beans; then the pasta courses – pasta bignè and the maccheroni di Sant'Antonio (thick, square-cut spaghetti made by hand and dressed with slow-cooked mutton ragu). Lamb takes centre stage among the mains, followed by a parade of desserts and bitter gentian liqueur. Ask why there are 50 dishes and people will shrug. But there is a historical reason. In a landscape where villagers were often exposed to hunger, cold and isolation, abundance took on a protective meaning. Eating well – and eating a lot – once a year became a way of pushing misfortune away; of asserting that there was enough to share, at least for one night. And then there's the Italian-style obligation. ""Eating everything is a duty,"" says Corona as she moves briskly among the tables. ""It's a sign of respect – for the community and for the people who have spent days cooking for you."" Fifty is a benchmark rather than a commandment: some panarde stop at around 40 courses, others go well beyond 60, depending on the house. No one will force you; you're just very firmly encouraged. If you truly cannot continue, your plate will be quietly removed… and in its place, a spicy serving of side eye. Despite the volume of food, there are no recorded stories of people falling ill after the panarda. Plates are not necessarily small, but courses are paced, alternating richer dishes with simpler ones, allowing the meal to unfold over many hours rather than overwhelm at once. ""Don't be afraid – just eat,"" laughs Candiloro Ricci, who emigrated to Canada more than 60 years ago and, like many others, returns to ""Villa"" every January. ""You won't find flavours like these anywhere else."" A village at risk Villavallelonga sits inside the mountainous Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park, famous for its wild wolves and black bears. The air is clean, the water abundant, the silence profound. All that beauty comes at a cost; more than half the houses in the historic centre now stand empty. ""Living in a protected, intact environment is a privilege,"" says Villavallelonga mayor Leonardo Lippa, ""but it also makes everything more difficult. We've been losing residents for decades. Services disappear, schools shrink, opportunities vanish."" Young people leave for Rome or North America, following paths traced by earlier waves of emigration. As a result, the panarda has found life across the ocean. ""It's not just a dinner,"" says Francis Cretarola, a Philadelphia restaurateur whose grandfather emigrated from Villavallelonga. ""What really matters is sharing. Sitting down together, slowing down, taking care of one another – these are things our world is gradually losing."" To embrace the slower, more grounded way of life his grandfather once described, Cretarola returns to Abruzzo for several months each year and now recreates the panarda feast at his restaurant, Le Virtù. Last year, Cretarola and his team served 42 dishes over a single day to 40 diners, turning the ritual into a marathon celebration of pan-Abruzzese cooking. More like this: • Want Italy's best food? Head to its national parks • The Italian city where life is sweetest in winter • The return of Sicily's ancient white gold Now here in Villavallelonga, he is plotting menus for this year's ticketed edition, which will take place on 14 June, running from 12:00 to 20:00 and featuring more than 40 courses and 10 Abruzzese wines.""Panarda should exist everywhere,"" he says. ""Only here does a meal truly become a celebration of life. And only here does everyone eat for free."" The Philadelphia version, he admits, does have a price – with part of the proceeds donated to a nearby food bank. Food writer Domenica Marchetti, who has attended both the Abruzzese panarda and its Philadelphia counterpart, agrees. ""The spirit is the same – the generosity, the way barriers fall between people at the table,"" she says. ""When it was over, I felt as if I were surrounded by the Apennines, even though we were still in South Philly."" Here in the Apennines, the panarda remains a powerful gravitational force – one that the community hopes can anchor a form of slow tourism rooted in food, walking and shared experiences. As interest grows, the idea of a public panarda night is sometimes raised. The challenge lies in reconciling a tradition meant to be free with the practical costs of feeding a large crowd. It's a challenge many in Villavallelonga say they would be willing to take on. It is now 02:30, and across Villavallelonga's 90 panarde, people are still eating. Plates of fritters, fruit tarts, biscuits and cream-filled pastries are circulating, while the Corona's dining room hums with conversation. A group of musicians bursts into the room, singing Saint Anthony's Song; its verses repeated like a mantra. ""It all feels like a small miracle,"" Cretarola says. ""An antidote to the anxieties of modern life. I just hope it stays this way."" ""Tomorrow we'll burn the pupazze – and that's when it hits me,"" says Angelo Ricci, a young pupazza craftsman, touching his chest. ""Because I know I'll have to wait a whole year for it to come back."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

33,BBC,What we know about the abduction of Savannah Guthrie's mother,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdex1nlrj07o,"The mystery surrounding the disappearance of the 84-year-old mother of NBC News anchor Savannah Guthrie has deepened, as the family and investigators continue to search for clues in the case. Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Tucson, Arizona, last weekend and authorities believe she was taken against her will. Police in Arizona have not yet identified a person of interest in the suspected abduction and continue to investigate a series of apparent ransom notes that may have been sent from the person or people behind the alleged crime. The Guthrie family has made several public pleas for her safe return, and has asked for proof that their mother is still alive. Here is what we know about the case.  Guthrie was last seen at her home in Catalina Foothills, an affluent neighbourhood roughly six miles (10km) north-east of Tucson, on Saturday evening, when family members dropped her off around 21:30 local time (04:30 GMT). At 01:47 local time on Sunday, a doorbell camera to her home was disconnected and removed, but officials said she did not have a subscription, so no footage could be recovered. At 02:12, software data detected movement on camera near the home, but there is no video available and the sheriff acknowledged an animal could have caused the motion. At 02:28, the app on her pacemaker, an implanted cardiac device, disconnected from her phone. Concern grew on Sunday morning when members of her church noticed she was missing and notified her family. After the family called 911, authorities began a search that soon included volunteers and federal officers from Border Patrol, which stretched into the next morning. Police have said they found blood on Nancy Guthrie's porch and analyses confirmed it was hers. Officials have warned that she may be in dire health without her medication. She has been described as ""not in good physical health"", but has no reported cognitive issues, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said. In a video message, Savannah Guthrie and her siblings said: ""Her health, her heart is fragile. She lives in constant pain. ""She is without any medicine. She needs it to survive. She needs it not to suffer."" The case has garnered nationwide attention, with dozens of reporters and camera crews descending on the quiet Arizona suburb where Nancy lives. Authorities have closed access to her street, nestled below the Santa Catalina mountains on roads lined with the state's iconic Saguaro cactus. FBI Special Agent Heith Janke said his agency was reviewing a ransom note sent to several media outlets. Details about an Apple watch and a floodlight at Nancy Guthrie's home were in the note. Police said one ransom note sent to the media had two deadlines: one at 17:00 on Thursday, which has since passed, and another on Monday. The FBI also said it had arrested a person for a fake ransom note on Thursday morning. Then on Friday, authorities said they were investigating a new message related to the case. A statement from the FBI and the sheriff's office said they are ""inspecting the information provided in the message for its accuracy"". The statement did not say who received the note, or any details that it may have contained. A presenter for a local affiliate of CBS News told the BBC that her channel received the ""message"". It is unclear if it was sent to other media outlets. The presenter did not detail what was in the message. In her emotional plea, Savannah Guthrie said she and her family were aware of the ransom note as well. She addressed the potential abductor or abductors directly. ""We are ready to talk,"" she said, adding that, ""we need to know without a doubt that she is alive and you have her... Please, reach out to us."" In a separate video on Thursday, her brother Camron said that the family still had not received any contact from ""whoever is out there holding our mother"", adding: ""We want to hear from you"". Authorities have urged the public to call the sheriff's office with any information, vowing to look into all leads, and discouraging the spread of misinformation. In the social media post on Wednesday the sheriff's office said ""the sharing of unverified accusations or false information is irresponsible and does not assist the investigation"". On Friday, officials said they are offering a reward of $50,000 (£36,000) for information that leads to an arrest. US President Donald Trump, who ordered federal authorities help in the investigation, has called the case a ""very unusual situation"". He said on Friday that he believed authorities ""have some clues"" and they we ""could have some answers"" soon. Guthrie, 54, is an American broadcast journalist who has served as the co-anchor of NBC News' TODAY since 2012. She is also the network's chief legal correspondent and a primary anchor for its election coverage. Previously, she was NBC News' White House correspondent. Guthrie was born in Australia but when she was a toddler her family moved to Tucson, Arizona where she grew up for most of her childhood. She did not travel back to Australia until 2015, visiting with her mom Nancy and fulfilling her ""lifelong dream to return"", she told The Daily Telegraph. ""For my mum to come back and get to see where she used to live brings back a lot of happy memories with my dad,"" Guthrie told the Daily Telegraph. Guthrie, who maintains a public stance of political neutrality, has interviewed presidents Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Trump. She has a law degree from Georgetown University and a bachelor's degree in journalism from the University of Arizona. She has won an Edward R Murrow Award for ethical electronic journalism and multiple News Emmys, including for an interview with Trump a month before the 2020 election. Savannah Guthrie, who hosts the Today show, has not been on air this week. She had been due to co-host the Winter Olympics opening ceremony for NBC on Friday, but will no longer take part in coverage to focus on being with her family, NBC said. ""Our hearts are with her and the entire Guthrie family as the search continues for their mother,"" a spokesperson for the network said. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Nearly 200 decaying bodies were discovered at the Return to Nature home after officials investigated a foul smell. Some desperate Iranians want US intervention, but others worry that it would not achieve the peace protesters ultimately want. The BBC's Regan Morris is in Tucson, Arizona, where 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home almost one week ago."
34,BBC,Who is in the Epstein files?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqxynz2l0g2o,"The list of some of the world's most rich and powerful people with ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has lengthened, after the US government released millions of new files from its investigation into the disgraced financier. There is no suggestion that appearing in the documents implies any wrongdoing. Many people who have featured in previous releases have denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein. Here is a list of some of the people mentioned in the latest release. The documents include email correspondence between Epstein and tech billionaire Elon Musk over travel plans Epstein appeared to be arranging, although Musk has said he has never visited Epstein's private island. In November 2012, Musk wrote in one email: ""What day/night will be the wildest party on your island?"" In another, from December the same year, he wrote:  ""I really want to hit the party scene in St Barts or elsewhere and let loose"", adding that a ""peaceful island experience"" is the opposite of what he's wanting. Response: Musk responded in an X post in January, acknowledging that the emails might be used to ""smear my name"", but said he was more concerned about the prosecution of ""those who committed serious crimes with Epstein"". Two emails from 18 July 2013 are written as though drafted by Epstein, but it is unclear if they are genuine or were ever sent to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. One email is written as a resignation letter from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and complains about having had to procure medicine for Gates ""to deal with the consequences of sex with Russian girls"". In an interview with NPR, his ex-wife Melinda said the release of the documents brought up memories of their marital struggles. ""I'm able to take my own sadness and look at those young girls and say, my God, how did that happen to those girls?"" she said. ""At least for me, I've been able to move on in life, and I hope there's some justice for those now-women."" Response: A spokesperson for Gates told the BBC: ""These claims – from a proven, disgruntled liar – are absolutely absurd and completely false.""  The US president is mentioned hundreds of times in the newly released files, including a list compiled by the FBI last year of allegations made against Trump by callers to its national Threat Operation Center tip line. Many of these appear to be based on unverified tips received by the agency and were made without supporting evidence. The list includes numerous allegations of sexual abuse made against Trump, Epstein and other high-profile figures. Response: Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, with whom he says he severed contact decades ago, and has not been accused of any crimes by Epstein's victims. Photographs appearing to show Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor kneeling on all fours over a female lying on the ground have also been included in the latest Epstein files release. In two of the images, the former prince is seen touching the person, who is unidentified and fully clothed, on her stomach. Another image shows him staring directly at the camera. No context is supplied for the photos and it is unclear when and where they were taken. Response: BBC News has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Richard Branson's name appears hundreds of times in the files. In one 2013 exchange, Epstein thanks Branson for his recent hospitality and public relations advice, to which Branson replies that it was ""really nice"" seeing him, adding: ""Any time you're in the area would love to see you. As long as you bring your harem!"" Virgin Group has clarified that ""harem"" referred to three adult members of Epstein's team. Response: In a statement to the BBC, Virgin Group said Branson's contact with Epstein was ""only a few occasions more than twelve years ago, and was limited to group or business settings, such as a charity tennis event"". The statement added: ""When Epstein offered a charity donation, the Bransons asked their team to carry out due diligence before accepting the donation, which uncovered serious allegations. ""As a result of what the due diligence uncovered, Virgin Unite did not take the donation and Richard and Joan decided not to meet or speak with Epstein again. Had they had the full picture and information, there would have been no contact whatsoever – Richard believes that Epstein's actions were abhorrent and supports the right to justice for his many victims."" Sarah Ferguson, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's ex-wife, who is invariably known as Fergie, appears to also be mentioned in multiple emails, including when Epstein was still under house arrest. An email from an account believed to belong to Epstein says: ""I think Fergie can now say, I am not a pedo."" In another email exchange from April 2009 there is a request to meet Epstein for a ""quick cup of tea"", that includes the lines: ""My dear spectacular and special friend Jeffrey. You are a legend, and I am so proud of you."" Response: The emails do not indicate any wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Ferguson for a response. Epstein made $75,000 (£55,000) of payments to accounts connected to Lord Mandelson, bank statements released in the files suggest, including to his partner Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Lord Mandelson following claims he passed market-sensitive information to Epstein. In 2009, one year after Epstein pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor, da Silva sent an email requesting ""anything you can help me with"". Epstein replied: ""I will wire your loan amount immediately"". A separate email exchange appears to show Epstein arranging a place for Mandelson to stay at one of his New York apartments, with Epstein writing, ""thrilled to host and sad I'm not there"". Response: Lord Mandelson has said he will step down from the House of Lords. On Sunday, Mandelson reiterated his regret for ""ever having known Epstein"" and for continuing his association following Epstein's conviction. He has told the BBC he ""was never culpable or complicit in (Epstein's) crimes. Like everyone else I learned the actual truth about him after his death"". He has not responded to the allegations of leaking documents, but BBC understands that he maintains he did not act criminally and did not act for personal gain. He argues that he sought Epstein's expertise in the national interest during the 2008 global financial crisis. The files also contain thousands of messages that appear to be sent between the late convicted sex offender and one of Trump's former top advisers, Steve Bannon. Most messages were sent in 2018 and 2019 after Bannon left his role in the first Trump White House, as he was making a film about Epstein prior to his death. One text exchange shows Bannon apparently strategising with Epstein on how to change the narrative around his past crimes, suggesting ""first we need to push back on the lies"" and ""rebuild your image as philanthropist"". Response: Bannon, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC. An October 2018 text exchange between Miroslav Lajčák - who was serving as Slovakia's foreign minister at the time - and Epstein appeared to show the two messaging about girls and diplomacy. After Epstein sent an image, which cannot be seen in the record, Lajčák replies: ""Why don't you invite me for these games? I would take the 'MI' girl."" ""Who wouldn't,"" Epstein texts back. ""You can have them both, I am not possessive. And their sisters."" Response: Following the latest release of Epstein-related documents, Lajčák resigned from his current post as Slovakia's national security advisor. He is not accused of any wrongdoing. Billionaire businessman and US Commerce Department Secretary Howard Lutnick planned a visit to Jeffrey Epstein's island Little Saint James with his family, according to emails included in the latest Epstein files' release. In one email from December 2012, Lutnick's wife Allison wrote to Epstein's assistant on what appeared to be the eve of the visit: ""We are looking forward to visiting you"", and, ""We would love to join you for lunch"". Response: The Commerce Department said in a statement to the BBC that ""Secretary Lutnick had limited interactions with Mr Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing"". Larry Summers, US President Bill Clinton's former treasury secretary and former Harvard University president, is also in the new documents, including references to meetings and dinners between Summers and Epstein. In emails from 2017, Summers and Epstein joked about Trump and criticised him during his first term. ""Your world does not understand how dumb he really is,"" Epstein said of Trump in one email to Summers. Response: After Summers was mentioned amid a batch of Epstein files released in November, he said he took ""full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein"" and resigned from multiple posts, including his role on the advisory board of OpenAI. Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, is shown in the release of Epstein-related documents inquiring about a woman he met at Epstein's house. In one email exchange, Tisch asked whether the woman was a professional or a ""civilian"". In other exchanges, Epstein tells Tisch he had a ""present"" for him and described a woman he would introduce Tisch to as ""tahitian speaks mostly french, exotic"". Response: In a statement to CNN, Tisch said he and Epstein ""had a brief association"", adding that he ""did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island"". The director of the new documentary on First Lady Melania Trump also appeared in a photo embracing a young woman in the files. Brett Ratner, who also directed the Rush Hour films and X-Men: The Last Stand, can be seen sitting on a sofa beside Epstein and two women whose identities have been obscured. Response: There is no indication of wrongdoing from the files. The BBC has contacted Ratner's representative for comment. The anti-aging influencer and CBS News contributor, Peter Attia, exchanged hundreds of emails with Epstein, including crass comments, the latest documents release shows. In the emails, he wrote that his friendship with Epstein was something he could share publicly and included a discussion of the 2018 Miami Herald story that identified some of Epstein's victims. He also joked with Epstein about the female anatomy and acts of sex, emails show. Response: On 2 February, Attia made a statement on X rejecting that he was ""involved in any criminal activity"", adding that "" I was never on his plane, never on his island, and never present at any sex parties"". The chairman of the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games sent flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of Epstein. Casey Wasserman's messages to Maxwell, sent in 2003, show him saying: ""I think of you all the time... So what do I have to do to see you in a tight leather outfit?"" Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting and trafficking teenage girls to be sexually abused by the disgraced financier Epstein. Response: Wasserman said in a statement: ""I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light."" Sergey Brin, co-founder of Google and one of the world's richest men, visited Epstein's private island and made plans to dine at Epstein's home in New York City, according to the documents released on Friday. He also corresponded with Ghislaine Maxwell, who wrote to Brin in April 2003: ""Dinners at Jeffrey's are always happily casual and relaxed"", and, ""Look forward to seeing you"". Response: The BBC has reached out to Google for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing in the emails. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is mentioned in the newly released Epstein-related documents, showing they corresponded on multiple occasions after Epstein was convicted for sex crimes in Florida in 2008. One exchange shows plans for Barak to stay at Epstein's New York City residence in 2017. Response: Barak has acknowledged his regular interactions with Epstein but said he never observed or participated in any inappropriate behaviour or parties. Noam Chomsky, the famed linguist, appeared in both releases of the Epstein files, and the latest tranche of documents suggests Chomsky advised Epstein on media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him. In emails from February 2019, the disgraced financier asked Chomsky if he should ""defend myself"" or ""try to ignore"". A response that appears to be from Chomsky laments ""the horrible way"" Epstein was treated and the ""hysteria that has developed about abuse of women"". ""It's painful to say, but I think the best way to proceed is to ignore it,"" the email said. Response: The appearance of Chomsky's name in the files does not imply wrongdoing. The BBC has contacted Chomsky's wife Valeria, who is his spokesperson, for comment. Brad Karp, the chairman of prestigious law firm Paul Weiss, stepped down from his role after the latest files showed dozens of apparent email exchanges between him and Epstein. One correspondence reportedly is said to show Karp discussing Epstein's pre-existing plea deal on sex trafficking charges. In an email sent in March 2019, four months before Epstein's arrest, a sender named Brad Karp said: ""The draft motion is in great shape."" Bloomberg reported that this discussion related to Epstein's efforts to protect the 2008 plea deal he struck with prosecutors, in which he avoided federal charges, which could have seen him face life in prison. There is nothing in the emails to prove that they were in fact linked  to the plea deal. Response: Announcing his resignation in a company statement on Wednesday, Karp said: ""Recent reporting has created a distraction and has placed focus on me that is not in the best interests of the firm."" The statement did not mention the Epstein files, and Karp has not commented since. The BBC has contacted Paul Weiss for further comment. In the justice department's first release of Epstein documents in December, several images showed former US President Bill Clinton, including a picture of him swimming in a pool, and another with him lying on his back with his hands behind his head in what appears to be a hot tub. Clinton was photographed with Epstein several times over the 1990s and early 2000s, before Epstein was first arrested. Response:  A spokesman for Clinton, Angel Ureña, said on social media in December that photos released by the Department of Justice (DoJ) were decades old. ""They can release as many grainy 20-plus-year-old photos as they want, but this isn't about Bill Clinton. Never has, never will be,"" he said. ""There are two types of people here. The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We're in the first,"" he said. In a post on social media, Clinton said that he had told Congress everything he knows. ""I have called for the full release of the Epstein files. I have provided a sworn statement of what I know,"" he said. ""And just this week, I've agreed to appear in person before the committee."" Clinton will testify before the House Oversight Committee later this month, and has called for the hearing to be public. The files appear to reveal communication between Epstein and the self-help author Deepak Chopra years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from minors. In a February 2017 email, Chopra seemingly asks Epstein to come to Israel with him and an unnamed group. ""Come to Israel with us,"" Chopra says. ""Relax and have fun with interesting people. [if] you want use a fake name . Bring your girls. It will be fun to have you . Love"" In another apparent exchange a month later, the pair talk about God and cells of the human body before Chopra says: ""Cells are human constructs. No such thing ! Universe is human construct No such thing. Cute girls are aware when they make noise."" Later in the discussion, Chopra adds: ""God is a construct. Cute girls are real."" Epstein also asks the alternative medicine advocate: ""Did you find me a cute Israeli?"" Response: Since these emails emerged, Chopra has posted a statement online saying he was ""deeply saddened by the suffering of the victims in this case"" and denied his involvement in ""any criminal or exploitative conduct."" ""Any contact I had was limited and unrelated to abusive activity. Some past email exchanges have surfaced that reflect poor judgment in tone. I regret that and understand how they read today, given what was publicly known at the time. My focus remains on supporting accountability, prevention, and efforts that protect and support survivors."" The BBC has asked Chopra if in his dealings with Epstein, he was aware of any wrongdoing. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona. Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of an NBC News presenter, is believed to have been abducted from her home in Tucson, Arizona. Nearly 200 decaying bodies were discovered at the Return to Nature home after officials investigated a foul smell. Some desperate Iranians want US intervention, but others worry that it would not achieve the peace protesters ultimately want."
35,BBC,He has the world's biggest stage. What will Bad Bunny do with it?,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0y18g8g7ro,"Two American football teams - the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots - will vie for the championship title on Sunday during Super Bowl LX. But mid-game there's a separate, equally high-profile battle brewing: a culture war. Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who has been tapped as the show's headliner, has attracted an unprecedented level of criticism for his outspoken opposition to US immigration policy - with some even calling for his deportation, even though he is a US citizen. It's not exactly new. Half-time performances have a history of sparking controversy - from Janet Jackson's infamous wardrobe malfunction in 2004, to the live debut of Beyoncé's Black Lives Matter anthem Formation in 2016. But this year's show ignited debates before Bad Bunny - the most streamed artist in the world, who primarily performs in Spanish - even took the stage. Republicans balked at his politics, with an Alabama senator dubbing it the ""woke bowl"". US President Donald Trump called Bad Bunny's selection ""absolutely ridiculous,"" and the Speaker of the House summed it up as a ""terrible decision"". The pushback even sparked a competing half-time event from conservative organisation Turning Point USA, which will air an ""All American"" counter-programme during Bad Bunny's set that will be headlined by Trump ally Kid Rock. With tens of millions expected to tune into the performance, what Bad Bunny will do in front of the crowd is anyone's guess. At a press conference on Thursday, the 31-year-old hinted that his performance would be more about unity and healing than spreading division. ""I know that the world is gonna be happy at this Sunday, and they're gonna have fun, and they're gonna dance and they're gonna have a good time,"" he said. At the Grammy Awards last week, where he walked away with the ceremony's biggest prize, he was more direct. Before thanking his producers and label, he took the mic and declared ""ICE out"" - a reference to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers who have led large operations detaining immigrants in cities across the US. Trump was elected in part due to his promise to curb illegal immigration, and the White House says its policies are aimed at protecting the public by deporting those here illegally who have criminal records. Those operations have come under scrutiny, including recently after federal agents killed two American citizens in separate incidents in Minneapolis. ""We're not savage. We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans and we are Americans,"" Bad Bunny said onstage in English. Eddie Miranda, a Puerto Rican DJ in the Chicago area, tells the BBC that seeing Bad Bunny - who was born Born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio - headline on Sunday will feel deeply personal. ''Puerto Rico is part of the United States, and not a lot of people know that,"" Miranda said. ""To have a piece of America that's been ignored for so long on the stage is just extraordinary."" Miranda said seeing Bad Bunny - who in 2016 worked as a grocery store cashier - represent Puerto Rico, an American territory, with pride, love, and authenticity ""means everything"". Whether at a quinceañera - a sweet-16 birthday party - or a club, Miranda says the moment the first Bad Bunny beat drops, the energy in the room comes alive. That's why, Miranda believes, the NFL chose him ""to be that pioneer"". ''With the hard times we're dealing with, when it comes to ICE and deportation, he'll be a leader for the whole Latino community,"" he said. ''He will speak on those matters somehow, either through symbolism or him saying something directly"". Bad Bunny's presence on the half-time stage is ""profoundly political"", said Vanessa Díaz, professor at Loyola Marymount in Chicano and Latino studies and co-author of P FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance. While pop-punk band Green Day will join the performance, he will be the first artist ever to perform the half-time show entirely in Spanish. The show is one of the most-watched music events in the world, often drawing more than 100m viewers in the US alone. It regularly produces memorable, meme-worthy moments, such as Katy Perry's iconic ""left shark"" in 2015. But in recent years, especially under the guidance of Jay Z's Roc Nation, the show has sparked national political conversations. During Coldplay and Bruno Mars' half-time show in 2016, special guest Beyoncé's homage to the Black Panther party, which featured dancers adorned with leather and berets, led to calls to boycott the artist. Jennifer Lopez and Shakira - whose 2020 set featured Bad Bunny - used imagery during their set that evoked children in cages, which was interpreted as a condemnation of Trump's immigration policies. Lopez also donned a cape that featured both the US and Puerto Rico flags. Whether Bad Bunny will implicitly or explicitly address the divisive nature of US politics remains to be seen. But experts and fans alike are certain he will - somehow. As a long-time fan, Kimberly Contreras, a Latina from New York, said she was confident that Bad Bunny would use the Super Bowl stage to make a statement. ""He speaks up for what he thinks politically. He doesn't change who he is for anyone. If people are uncomfortable with that, that's on them."" Bad Bunny has said he feels a responsibility, as someone with influence, to highlight important issues. He has consistently used his platform and music to not only showcase his culture, but support the LGBTQ community and advocate for Puerto Rico's self-determination, which has remained an overseas US territory since 1898. ""What makes Bad Bunny so exciting, is that we really never know what we're going to get with him. He has kind of always done the unexpected,"" Díaz said. During his last tour, the rapper declined to visit any mainland US cities over concerns about immigration enforcement officers detaining fans at his concerts. Instead, he opted for a residency in Puerto Rico that boosted the island's economy by millions. The opening track of his Grammy-winning album DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS (DTMF), NUEVAYoL, is accompanied by a music video set in New York in which a Donald Trump-like voice delivers a formal apology that says ""this country is nothing without the immigrants"". The video also features Bad Bunny hoisting the pre-US Puerto Rican flag onto the crown of the Statue of Liberty. Simply performing those songs during his set will be highly polarising, experts say. ""Bad Bunny is offering another vision of what American-ness is - a vision that is not in line with what Trump and the Trump administration is selling,"" said Albert Laguna, associate professor in American Studies at Yale University, who taught a course on Bad Bunny's musical aesthetics and politics. He also made headlines after condemning the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, which devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, accusing officials of abandoning the island and failing to provide adequate aid to residents - who are US citizens but lack voting status and representation in US Congress. About 3,000 people died in the storm, which destroyed infrastructure and caused $90bn (£68bn) in damage. The Trump administration has said it delivered a ""swift and historic"" response, providing billions of dollars in federal assistance to help rebuild Puerto Rico. His growing cultural significance is why Laguna and Diaz think the NFL needs Bad Bunny more than Bad Bunny needs the NFL, citing the league's push in recent years to attract more Latinos to American football and further extend the brand's global reach with expo games in London and Mexico. For the NFL, platforming artists such as Bad Bunny signals a shift from its more conservative past. After Bad Bunny denounced ICE at the Grammy Awards, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell praised the superstar and reaffirmed the league's decision to spotlight him: ""He understood the platform he was on, and that this platform is used to unite people."" Fans who attended Bad Bunny's residency in Puerto Rico told the BBC that they hope the halftime show will harness the same energy and spirit. Many anticipate the appearance of La Casita, a salmon-coloured structure featured on his world tour designed to resemble a traditional Puerto Rican home. ""I hope he doesn't let critics determine what kind of songs he plays,"" said Victor Almeda, a Puerto Rican living in Orlando, Florida. ""It's important to stick to his roots and represent Puerto Rico the most he can."" The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. Meet the fans travelling the world to see their hero Robbie Williams in concert. Keith Duffy and Brian McFadden are still enjoying touring together - even if they don't sell as many tickets as Westlife.

37,BBC,Zambian leader backs traditional Ghanaian outfit after online trolling,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5y5w2z344o,"Zambia's president has weighed into a cultural debate that has erupted online after the president of Ghana arrived in Zambia wearing a traditional outfit called a fugu. Some Zambians mockingly called it a ""blouse"". But Zambia's leader hit back by sharing his love for the design, saying he would be ""ordering more of that stuff"" for himself, in a video posted on X from the Ghana–Zambia Business Forum held in Lusaka this week. Ghana's foreign minister said the social media buzz was a sign that young people were keen to reclaim their cultural roots. In Ghana itself, a move to encourage traditional outfits has led to ""Fugu Friday"", which sees people wear African clothing. Following days of online back and forth between netizens of the two countries, President Hakainde Hichilema expressed his admiration for the Ghanaian outfit. ""We'll be ordering more fugu from Ghana following the social media conversations,"" Hichilema said on Friday in Zambia's capital, Lusaka. When Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama arrived for a three-day State Visit on Wednesday, he was proudly sporting a fugu - a traditional northern Ghanaian outfit made from hand‑woven, narrow strips of thick cotton fabric stitched together to form a structured, poncho‑style garment. In contrast, his Zambian counterparts was wearing a suit and tie to welcome him at the airport. This elicited a strong reaction from some Zambians online, for example there were dozens of mocking comments on the Zambian Scorpion Facebook group. Malama Mulenga referred to the fugu as a ''maternity blouse'', Mwangala Imbula posted: ''Am coming to get that blouse'', while Master G wrote  ''We love our blouse brothers''. Ghanaian officials attending the forum responded by highlighting the deep cultural significance of the fugu. Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa described it as not just an item of clothing but a symbol of African identity, dignity, and heritage. In a video posted on Facebook, he said that the viral buzz had sparked renewed interest among young people and ignited what he called a renaissance of the ""African personality"". He encouraged Africans to reclaim and celebrate their cultural roots. ""For the young ones on social media who want to know more about the attire… this is the attire that the founder of Ghana, Osagyefo Kwame Nkrumah, wore when he declared independence on the 6th of March 1957 in Ghana,"" he said. A popular Ghanaian YouTuber also threw his hat into the debate. Wode Maya declared that it was not a ''blouse'', and that ''the president is intentionally promoting the local garment industry both within and beyond our borders''. He added that ''it is unfortunate that many of you, despite having access to smartphones and the internet, still choose to remain ignorant''.

38,BBC,'My life was transformed when I got rare sheep disease on holiday',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3942gv9z1vo,"When Sally Crowe returned from holiday with what felt like ""the worst hangover ever"" she had no idea it would transform her life forever. The illness would leave her bedbound for almost two years and struggling with its after effects for more than a decade, but she says it has ultimately given her a new outlook on life. Sally, who runs a 65-acre croft with sheep and cattle in Caithness, has become a popular figure after featuring on BBC TV show This Farming Life. But the 48-year-old says her approach to farming had to change after she caught Q fever on a visit to Western Australia in 2012. She had been visiting friends who were working in a sheep-shearing shed when she caught the rare and potentially life-threatening airborne disease contracted from farm animals. When she returned to the UK feeling unwell her initial symptoms left medics stumped. ""I went back and forth to the doctors and they had no idea what it could be,"" Sally says. ""We looked at Lyme disease which is very similar to Q fever but nothing came back."" She says it took 18 months to figure out what was causing her symptoms. ""Initially I was diagnosed with ME - a chronic fatigue - and told there was nothing they could do,"" she says. ""I had gone from being really active to doing nothing and spending 18 hours a day in bed."" Even after being diagnosed, it was another four years until Sally found a treatment plan that had an impact. ""When we found out it was Q fever there weren't many treatment options in Scotland,"" she says. ""I had heard of it but it's very rare here. ""Only 5% of people who get the infection actually go on to develop chronic Q fever so it's just one of those really unlucky things. ""It's a hard infection to treat, the medication can't kill the infection, it will always be there. You can only get it under control."" After carrying out research online, Sally found a specialist in South Africa and started treatment in 2016. She was put on a year-long course of drugs consisting of one week of antibiotics followed by three weeks of an anti-malarial medication. ""It was really rough, going through week after week of treatment,"" she says. ""It was really awful at times and hard going. ""The first couple of months I didn't feel much difference but the third month hit me hard and really kicked in."" Despite a challenging start to the treatment it soon became life-changing, as week- by-week pieces of her life were put back in place. She welcomed her son William in 2019 through IVF and has since found a new appreciation for putting life before work. ""I realised I couldn't go on doing what I was doing,"" she says ""I was burning myself out, I wasn't making any money and I thought I would have to give up the croft. ""I spent a long time being seriously ill, when you don't have the energy to do the things you want and you've been stuck in bed for so long, you realise what is important. ""It completely changed my life. Now if I do physical work one day I can only do something that involves mental strength the next."" Sally continues to run the croft - which has been in her family since 1972 - with 60 breeding ewes, about nine cows and dozens of hens. But her main joy is spending time with her six-year-old son William. ""I feed the cows before my son finishes school and do the basics on the croft then spend time with William,"" she says. ""I don't work weekends usually - they are there to enjoy. ""I want to spend time with him and hang out. He is six now and still thinks I am really cool. ""So I probably only have another seven or so years of that, I want to make the most of it."" According to the NHS website, Q fever is a bacterial infection you can catch from infected farm animals such as sheep, cattle and goats. It's usually harmless, but it can cause serious problems. Some people get flu-like symptoms within two to three weeks of being infected, including a high temperature, aching muscles, tiredness and feeling sick. It is most often spread to humans by close contact with infected farm animals, especially through their blood, urine, faeces and animal skin, fur and wool. Although Q fever is rare, people who work closely with animals are more at risk, such as farmers, vets, stable hands and abattoir workers. There is currently no licensed vaccine for Q fever available in the UK. Chronic Q fever sometimes leads to serious heart problems, such as endocarditis.

40,BBC,'They sent a letter asking to preach. Then they massacred us' - Nigerians on jihadist attack,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dkd3llw1lo,"More than 100 armed jihadists dressed in army fatigues rode into the neighbouring Muslim villages of Woro and Nuku in Nigeria's western state of Kwara on motorbikes - driven by revenge. ""They came en masse in the name of religion, and they decided to kill our people,"" Abdulla Umar Usman, a former teacher and resident of Woro, told the BBC, explaining how the attack, in which at least 75 people are so far known to have been killed, unfolded. The mayhem started an hour before sunset on Tuesday as residents of the farming community were heading home from their fields, where they grow yams, maize and millet. The militants headed straight to the home of traditional leader Umar Bio Salihu - because they had written to him asking if they could come and preach what is considered an extremist version of Islam, which the community did not welcome. Salihu was not at his home in Woro at the time, so they set his compound alight and killed two of his children. ""Two of the community head's children, who were medical students, were killed in front of the house before they set it ablaze,"" Usman said. The jihadists then went on a killing spree that lasted all night. ""They massacred everyone. It is just devastating,"" Mohammed Dauda, a local official, told the BBC. Amnesty International said many of the dead had been found with their hands and feet tied - some had had their throats slit, others had been shot dead. When the jihadists left in the morning, they took with them 38 women and children, including the rest of the traditional ruler's family. ""They killed two of my children and abducted my wife and three children,"" Salihu told me. The militants wanted residents to renounce the Nigerian government and its constitution and instead follow their teachings, effectively attempting to impose a parallel system of rule and government in the area. This was ""against what the Quran teaches"", Salihu said, referring to Islam's holy book. The Nigerian government has blamed Boko Haram for the attack - the jihadist group has not issued any statement about it. Boko Haram, which gained global attention in 2014 after abducting more than 200 schoolgirls from Chibok, is still operating in the north-east of the country but has since splintered. One of its factions, Mahmuda, is now active in rural parts of Kwara and the neighbouring state of Niger. According to Amnesty, the jihadists had been leafleting the two villages for the last five months. ""These communities have been receiving these pamphlets, soliciting them to join the extremist views and preaching by these militants,"" Isa Sanusi, head of Amnesty International in Nigeria, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""After they see a bit of resistance from the people, they then started sending them warnings,"" he added. This correlates with Usman's account - that locals had received warnings days before the violence began. Local MP Saidu Baba Ahmed told the BBC said the latest communication had been sent to Salihu, who had contacted the security forces about the letter. The military went to the area briefly to investigate, but after they left, the jihadists launched their assault, he said. Amnesty says this shows a ""stunning security failure"". ""We are wondering why this security lapse was allowed to happen, why the authorities could not take action,"" Sanusi said. He described how over many hours no-one went to the villagers' aid - and the militants were able to ""take their time"". ""In fact, they even went to the mosque and prayed there. They forced a few people to go and listen to their preaching. That means they had enough time… adequate time to do whatever they liked,"" Sanusi added. The security forces did arrive the next day to find large parts of Woro and Nuku, which fall under the administrative area of Kaiama, in ruins. Shops and homes had been burnt, abandoned motorcycles lined the streets and smoke still hung in the air. The once-busy market stalls stood empty, as families gathered to comfort one another. Then began the grim task of burying the bodies - first recovering them from the bushes. Dauda, the local official, said he accompanied soldiers and helped bury dozens of victims. ""I was among those who buried 30 corpses,"" he said. ""We have never experienced this before in Kaiama local government area."" Residents say the men assigned to dig graves for mass burials worked throughout the day until they became exhausted and were unable to continue. It has left mourners in Woro and Nuku  physically and emotionally broken. Even now the dusty red-sand roads around the town remain deserted. Kwara State Governor AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, who visited the area on Wednesday night, said President Bola Tinubu had approved the immediate deployment of an army battalion to respond to the attack. Usman suspects the attackers emerged from the forested areas near the Kainji Lake National Park, where the militants are known to operate. He said the military had carried out operations in nearby forests months to target armed groups. Communities in Kwara are also vulnerable to raids by criminal gangs - known locally as ""bandits"" - who loot and kidnap for ransom and have moved into the religiously diverse state fairly recently. This has led most settlements in rural areas to set up vigilante groups – small bands of armed men who protect their villages. In fact, according to the MP, the militants had tried to attack the villages last year but had been fought off by the vigilantes. What leaves the residents of Woro and Nuku in such distress this time is that the jihadists knew exactly where the vigilantes lived - and picked them off not long after dealing with the house of the traditional leader. ""They knew where they were and they went straight to attack them,"" Salihu said. ""They burnt them into ashes… about eight of them."" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

41,BBC,YouTube's $60bn revenue revealed amid paid subscriber push,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkrkd2xlx6o,"Google has revealed YouTube brought in more than $60bn (£44bn) in revenue in 2025 as the firm targets getting more subscribers. The figure, which totals the money generated through advertising on YouTube as well as paid subscriptions, far surpasses streaming rival Netflix's $45bn revenue. It appears to be the first time Google has individually highlighted its video platform's yearly revenue since acquiring it in 2006. Midia Research senior analyst Hanna Kahlert said while it was a big announcement, it was ""perhaps not a surprising one"" - with the platform becoming ""almost infrastructural for digital natives"". ""YouTube is one of – if not the – most-used of all digital offerings, with over 70% of international consumers using it weekly, and over 50% using it daily,"" she told the BBC, citing Midia consumer survey data. Kahlert said the different ways the platform makes money - such as through adverts, or charging a monthly subscription to remove them - means it can ""capitalise well"" on its large audience. While YouTube's global ad revenue in the last three months of 2025 fell below Wall Street expectations at $11.38bn (£8.37bn), Google boss Sundar Pichai highlighted YouTube's broader growth as part of a ""fantastic year"" for the company. He said YouTube Premium - its service letting users pay to remove ads between videos, or songs on its music service - had helped boost paid subscriptions across Google consumer services to more than 325 million in 2025 overall. The company has not released YouTube's own subscriber numbers. But Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, told investors on an earnings call on Wednesday YouTube was seeing ""strong traction"" in subscriptions. He said it has been ""innovating to meet consumers where they are"" with new, cheaper YouTube TV and Premium tiers. The firm has also been trying to find more ways to get people to subscribe - such as only allowing Premium users to play videos in the background on smartphones. At the same time, Shorts, YouTube's TikTok-style short videos, was also said to be averaging more than 200 billion daily views. As it celebrated its 20th birthday last year, YouTube swelled to become the second most-watched media service in the UK after the BBC, according to Ofcom. Ofcom later found the platform was used by 94% of UK adult internet users, with time spent on it growing to reach an average of 51 minutes a day per person. The UK's public service broadcaster recently announced plans to make shows for YouTube in a landmark deal. YouTube's $60bn revenue in 2025 meanwhile beat that of rival Netflix - though Forrester analyst Mike Proulx said it was not an ""apples-to-apples comparison"". ""The lion's share of YouTube's content is user-generated versus 'Hollywood'-generated,"" he said. But he said ""the competitive lines are blurring"", with Disney+ partnering with OpenAI on short-form user created content, while YouTube will host the Oscars from 2029. ""YouTube is not just cat videos anymore,"" Netflix boss Ted Sarandos told US lawmakers in a Senate hearing on Tuesday about its plans to buy Warner Bros. ""YouTube is TV"". Netflix has recently sought to ink deals with content creators, including popular YouTubers, in an effort to boost its own offerings. But some creators, including the world's biggest MrBeast, have voiced concern about the impact of AI. The rise of tools like Google's AI Overviews, its AI-generated summaries of search results, have been linked by some to dips in traffic to their videos, sites and content. The European Commission launched an investigation in December to examine the impact of Google's AI summaries on content creators and web publishers. The UK's markets regulator has since proposed measures to give publishers more controls over the appearance of their work in Google's AI summaries and products. Google said it believed it could ""find a path forward that provides even more choice to website owners and publishers"". But the company pledged in its latest results to plough even more money into AI - something big tech bosses say they will spend eye-watering sums on this year.

42,BBC,Google staff call for company to cut ties with ICE,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgjg98vmzjo,"Google executives are facing pressure from staff over the company's ties to the federal government's crackdown on immigration enforcement, which in recent months turned violent and deadly. In an open letter published on Friday, nearly 900 full-time Google employees demanded more transparency over what the company's technology is being used for inside the US government. Google has contracts to provide federal agencies with cloud services and also has links to work being done on federal immigration enforcement. In a call after the letter was published, a Google employee of seven years said he found it ""mind-boggling"" that Google was maintaining its ties with the immigration enforcement bodies. The letter from Google employees follows a separate letter published two weeks ago and signed by hundreds of workers at various companies, including Amazon, Microsoft and Meta, calling for all tech companies to stop their work supporting the federal immigration crackdown. In the last year, the Trump administration has stepped up its programme to forcibly remove immigrants, sending armed agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) into several cities. Operations to carry out such removals lead to two high-profile killings of US citizens who were observing federal agents. The Google employee forefronting the demands to management identified himself as Alex and said he joined the company seven years ago. ""I was proud to be working at a company with a moral compass. I'm not proud anymore,"" he said. In 2018, amid pressure from thousands of employees, Google abandoned a contract with the Pentagon known as Project Maven to develop more efficient drone technology for use by the US military. Alex added that he found it ""abhorrent"" coming to work each day now, knowing that his efforts were supporting the work of federal agents within Department for Homeland Security (DHS), ICE and CBP, or working on removing apps which the authorities find ""threatening"". In October, Google said it had removed several apps from its app store which allowed users to report and document sightings of ICE agents. Apple did so as well. Another Google employee, who identified herself as ""S"", said she came to work for Google about three years ago, but said that had she known then of its work with federal agencies, she would have not have joined. ""This is not the company I signed up to work for – I would have never interviewed to work for a military contractor,"" she said. Alex and S both said that they were speaking out now about Google's work with federal agencies because they objected to their work contributing towards militarised actions against people. They added that inside the company the Google leadership, including chief executive Sundar Pichai, had failed to address the extent of Google's work with the federal government, leading to the open letter demanding more transparency. Other demands from employees are that Google pull its technology from any work within DHS, ICE and CBP, that it provides its workers with protection from immigration enforcement activities, and that the company hold an all-hands meeting to address their concerns. In addition to Google's cloud services for parts of the federal government, the company last year entered into partnerships with Lockheed Martin, a large military contractor, to deploy Gemini AI models in unnamed products and services. Google also has a partnership with Palantir, a US company that provides much of the technology and operating systems used in operations for DHS, ICE and CBP, along with all six branches of the US military. Alex, S and other signatories of the open letter to Google have had their employment with the company verified through their registered work accounts. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. It's been days since 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie disappeared in the middle of night from her home in Arizona.

43,BBC,Epstein emails: So-called 'shady financier' was Andrew's 'trusted money man',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1kldw1e0w3o,"The Epstein files have cast new light on Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor's relationship with the controversial businessman David Rowland, revealing that Andrew told Jeffrey Epstein this was his ""trusted money man"". Emails seem to show Andrew trying to promote Rowland's financial ventures, at a time when Andrew was the UK' s trade envoy. However, Epstein appeared reluctant to engage with the multi-millionaire  Conservative Party donor, after he was warned that the UK press were calling Rowland a ""shady financier"". Rowland's son Jonathan told the BBC he and his father ""never had any contact or correspondence or had dinner or met with"" Epstein. Rowland's private bank, Banque Havilland, has since fallen foul of regulators in London and Luxembourg, and had its banking licence withdrawn in 2024 by the European Central Bank. It is appealling this. The latest emails, released by the US Department of Justice, appear to show Andrew encouraging Epstein to invest in the ventures of David and Jonathan Rowland. There have been many previous claims about links between Andrew and Rowland's private bank, but the Epstein emails also suggest Rowland lent money to Andrew's ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson. There also seems to be irritation at how she had spent it. ""Will finalise F summary for you next week. Can't now cause she went to nepal paying for the first class flight with her rowland bank loan,"" writes a business contact to Epstein in September 2009. This ""F"" appears to refer to Ferguson, who was photographed in Nepal the day the email was sent. Media reports have claimed in the past that Andrew also received money from Banque Havilland, though the BBC didn't find evidence of this in the latest batch of Epstein files. There have been many questions about Andrew's finances - and about his long-standing relationship with the banker Rowland. Jonathan Rowland did not deny to the BBC that he or his father or Banque Havilland might have paid or lent money to Andrew or Ferguson, but denied that he had ever provided money in exchange for access to contacts. In May 2010, Andrew appears to mention Rowland in an email to Epstein: ""You should know that I was seeing David Rowland, my trusted money man whom you know from a long time ago."" Rowland and his son Jonathan had a close relationship with Andrew, joining him on trips in his capacity as an official trade envoy, to places such as China and the former Soviet states. One email suggests Andrew was keen for one of Epstein's contacts to invest in the Rowlands' venture. But Epstein was wary. ""He is actively seeking high net worth individuals for his Private Bank. Perhaps this is an avenue for your undecided Chinese?"" Andrew apparently writes to Epstein, in October 2010. Epstein replies: ""His bank just might be the place.. I guess i should learn more."" However, a few months earlier a contact of Epstein had raised concerns about Rowland's reputation, mentioning that he was referred to in the press as a ""shady financier"". The phrase was first used in Parliament, and could therefore be repeated by journalists without risk of libel. ""He resigned his post as Tory treasurer last Thursday before he started,"" the contact warns. ""Before he started?? what?"" Epstein replies. A reply suggests that ""PA"" explained that Rowland ""decided not to take up the appointment. For numerous reasons not least to the internal situation in the party."" Another email suggests that Epstein was going to have dinner with Andrew, David and Jonathan Rowland in Hong Kong that year. But he appeared reluctant to commit to any business ventures. Epstein's associate writes to him in 2011: ""Jonathan Rowland asked me to join his new fund to invest in China, Russia, CIS [former Soviet countries] & Europe. He will send me material this week. I said I am very busy but will look at it. You need to tell me what you want me to do with this but I am working on the assumption to stay far away from it."" Jonathan Rowland admitted meeting this associate, but says he never mentioned Epstein. The same year, an email to Epstein from an associate notes that ""[Prince Andrew] was under scrutiny for dealing with Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan (but government approved!), he has full support of his Mum [the Queen]."" The emails suggest the closeness of Andrew to David Rowland, including that he was at Andrew's birthday party. David Rowland was a guest at the wedding of Andrew's daughter Princess Eugenie and Rowland had acted as Andrew's official representative at a funeral in London in 2015. The Epstein files also include a photo of an article from the Telegraph website, showing a montage of David Rowland, Andrew and Epstein side-by-side. The story claims that Rowland had paid off around £85,000 of Sarah Ferguson's debts, and that Epstein had paid off other debts. Epstein sent the photo to a contact listed simply as ""Rowland"", who appears not to have responded. Jonathan Rowland said he and his father had never seen it before. Author Andrew Lownie, who wrote the book Entitled about Andrew, described his links to David Rowland as ""essential in understanding how Andrew was able to make so much money"". He claims that Rowland played a ""crucial role in helping Andrew to monetise his royal status and government position as trade envoy"". Jonathan Rowland denied that he or his father had used contacts from his travels with Andrew to promote business deals and investments. Andrew has always denied wrongdoing and rejected claims that he had used his envoy role for his own personal gain. Sarah Ferguson and Banque Havilland's successor organisation Rangecourt did not respond to requests for comment.

44,BBC,Coin portrait of late Queen draws criticism in Australia,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70l0wzww50o,"Two commemorative coins, released by the Royal Australian Mint and bearing a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, have been criticised for their lack of resemblance to the late monarch. The $5 (£2.56) and 50 cent silver coins, created to commemorate the centenary of the Queen's birth, were released in an online ballot that closed on Wednesday. ""That's got to be the most unpleasant portrait on a coin,"" said one of several people who reacted negatively online. The Royal Australian Mint defended the portrait, saying: ""Our coin images don't always capture the full beauty of a design once it's etched in metal."" Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022 at the age of 96 and was the UK's longest serving monarch. ""There's a reason most portraits are from the side. Looks like she just ran into a wall,"" one person commented underneath a Facebook post from the mint. ""If I saw that face without the hairdo and pearls, would never guess who it was meant to be,"" another said. Comparisons have been made with various TV characters, including Mrs Doubtfire - the beloved fictional housekeeper in the comedy film of the same name, played by the late Robin Williams. Other people were more positive about the design, which was created by one of the mint's artists. ""Awesome. I'm glad they put something out to do with Queen Elizabeth II, she deserves to have Recognition In a Special Way,"" one user wrote on social media. ""Please pick me for one of these coins,"" said another. One woman living in the US commented that it ""looks like a beautiful coin"". Despite the criticism, collectors reported that the ballot was fully subscribed. Australian media, quoting a spokesperson for the Royal Australian Mint, said the silver proof coins had sold out, and there were limited stocks left in their contact centre and shop. According to the mint's website, it created 30,000 of the 50c coins and 5,000 of the $5 - all of which are collector's items and will not enter general public circulation. As well as the queen's portrait, the coins feature designs ""symbolically reflecting the many facets of Queen Elizabeth II's life and legacy"", the mint said. These include motifs of a horse and corgi, references to art and theatre to mark ""her enduring support for culture"", as well as some of her favourite flowers - roses and lily of the valley. The golden wattle, Australia's national floral emblem, is also represented. ""The design incorporates Her Majesty's Royal Cypher, a stylised St Edward's Crown and the Auxiliary Territorial Service emblem, acknowledging her wartime service and lifelong sense of duty,"" the mint added. Meanwhile, the backs of the coins feature a portrait of the Queen's son, King Charles, in profile. Find out who is in each squad for the Men's T20 World Cup which begins on 7 February.

And West Indies have lost both their openers as Brandon King hits it straight at point, where George Munsey fumbles it first time but secures the catch on the second attempt. Dawid MalanFormer England batter on Test Match Special All credit to Michael Leask there and Scotland. That was a big call by the captain to bowl an off-spinner to two set right-hand batters but it's paid off for them. Almost another wicket for Michael Leask there. New batter Shimron Hetmyer tries to assert control immediately but fails to read Leask's arm ball and top edges it. But it falls safely from the backpedalling bowler. Hope b Leask 19 (WI 54-1) Immediate impact from Michael Leask! And he gets the big wicket of West Indies captain Shai Hope. It's an arm-ball that does the trick for the Scotland off-spinner as Hope loses his off stump. Here's Oliver Davidson for his T20I debut for Scotland. And it's tidy over from the 20-year-old left-arm spinner, allowing only four runs from it. That seventh over was just what West Indies needed. Brandon King follows up the six with back-to-back boundaries off Safyaan Sharif to help West Indies bring up their 50. And with 17 runs off that over, the momentum has now shifted in their favour. After two boundaryâless overs, West Indies break free immediately after the drinks break. Brandon King steps down in the first ball of the seventh over and belts it straight down the ground and over the rope - that's the first six of the Windies innings. Kirstie GordonScotland bowler on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra I think it's tremendous from Scotland. They would have bitten your hand off for this against the real powerhouse of T20 cricket. I think their bowling has been on point and their fielding has been excellent. They've just made a fantastic start and I think they'll be very pleased with this. The final over of the powerplay is bowled by Mark Watt. The left-arm spinner mixes up his bowling wonderfully well to push West Indies onto the backfoot and gives away just two runs. Very impressive from Watt and Scotland in general so far! Kirstie GordonScotland bowler on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra Scotland's fielding has been on it today. For many of them, they have been in the indoor centre and snow in Scotland this winter. You always think when teams are a bit under cooked, the fielding can be sloppy but they've been on the money. Another bowling change for Scotland - this time Richie Berrington turning Safyaan Sharif's pace. He begins with three dot balls and only concedes four off his first over. With one more over left in the powerplay, a hint of pressure growing on the West Indies batters perhaps? First signs of real aggression from West Indies in this over. Brandon King goes after Brad Currie's first ball and it's in the air but drops just short of the fielder at deep backward point. The opener then gets it right three balls later as an edge runs away for four. Kirstie GordonScotland bowler on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra It's a fantastic opportunity for Scotland. The players have been very forthcoming in saying how lucky they are to have this opportunity and that their thoughts are with the Bangladesh players. It's been a really good start for Scotland. Early spin for Scotland as Mark Watt comes on for the third over. He starts decently but Shai Hope adjusts, rocking back and cutting the fourth ball away for four. Brad Currie attacks for Scotland from the other end and West Indies keep the scoreboard ticking early. Shai Hope finds his first boundary of the day, opening the face of the bat to gently guide the penultimate delivery through deep third for a four. Kirstie GordonScotland bowler on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra Brandon McMullen really pulled back that first over. I was interested to see him with the new ball, he was getting some really nice away shape. They will have done their homework, I'm not sure on the field setting but it might be a stroke of genius. There's something in the pitch that will please the Scottish spinners. Brandon McMullen comes back strongly after giving away easy runs off his first ball. Just three more runs from the over, and Brandon King nearly gifts his wicket away off the final delivery. He miscues his shot and it hung in the air for a moment only to drop safely. What a start from the West Indies. First ball from Brandon McMullen is an inviting one and Brandon King leans into it beautifully, driving through extra cover for four. The West Indies openers Brandon King and Shai Hope take their guard. And Brandon McMullen is at the top of his mark for the first ball, which is moments away."

Police officers were dispatched to a residence near Chattanooga in Tennessee on Thursday. Life-saving measures were attempted on a woman but she was already deceased. Lee, 31, was identified as the suspect and taken into custody, and on Friday was charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. He is due to appear in court on 11 February. ""Preliminary findings indicate the victim's death was the result of a homicide,"" read a statement from the Hamilton County sheriff's office. The name of the victim is being withheld until her next of kin has been informed. Lee, a first-round draft pick for the New York Jets in 2016, last played in the NFL for the Buffalo Bills in 2020.

47,BBC,Ski jumpers sceptical of penis injection reports,https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/czeje06yk4eo,"Norway ski jumper Johann Andre Forfang said the reports are ""not something we want in our sport"" Norwegian ski jumpers have said their sport does not need ""that kind of attention"" after it was reported that male athletes were injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. In January, German newspaper Bild, external reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits. Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by one or two centimetres. This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air. However, some Norwegian ski jumpers have reacted to the reports with scepticism. ""I do not think we need that kind of attention, and on the women's side we are quite calm about the subject,"" Norway women's coach Christian Meyer said. ""I have not seen anything like it, so I am also wondering whether it is true. I actually do not believe it."" Norwegian ski jumper Anna Odine Stroem added: ""If it takes something like this to get people watching ski jumping, I do not know what to think. ""It is sad that we need controversy for people to find our sport endearing or exciting."" Day-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics Full schedule including times of medal events Winter Olympics 2026 medal table Earlier this week, the World Anti-Doping Agency said it could investigate if evidence emerges that athletes are injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid. Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only ""elastic, body-tight underwear"". Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured. The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men. Hyaluronic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months. ""That is not something we want in our sport,"" Norway ski jumper Johann Andre Forfang said.

Switzerland midfielder Xhaka is back in England's top division after spending seven years at Arsenal from 2016-2023. Xhaka, 33, helped the Gunners win the FA Cup twice and reach the Europa League final but had an up-and-down time in north London, including a major fallout with supporters and being stripped of the club captaincy. After leaving Arsenal, he made an immediate impact at Bayer Leverkusen - helping them win the double in Germany. But the lure of a return to the Premier League proved too much as Xhaka, who started his career at Basel and also played for Borussia Monchengladbach. In an extended interview with Kelly Somers, Xhaka spoke about a range of things, including why he signed for Sunderland, and his clash with Arsenal fans. Xhaka will not be part of the Black Cats team that plays at the Emirates on Saturday because of injury. That has denied him the chance of what he said would be a ""very emotional"" return to his ""second home after Sunderland"". And Xhaka said he had ""a lot of respect"" for Gunners manager Mikel Arteta. ""He was the guy who kept me in the football club,"" he said. ""Everyone knows it and I will never forget what he did for me.""

I didn't get the minutes I wanted [on the pitch] and I wanted to leave in January after six months, but I had my dad behind me. He said: 'If you walk now, you will always walk away, so head down and just work.' I did, and everything changed. The second part is not a big secret. It was 2019 when I had this... I call it a misunderstanding... with the fans of Arsenal. Two moments where I think that I became stronger and better because it's part of a process. It's part of writing the whole history. On one side, very bad. On one side, I was lucky to have it. Kelly: Now you're back in the Premier League, have you had an opportunity to reflect on your whole period at Arsenal? Because you had some incredible highs as well as some really difficult moments... Granit: In general, I think people just think about this moment in 2019. But I came in 2016, so to be part of a football club for seven years makes me proud... it's not easy to be on this level for seven years. And, of course, when I left Arsenal it was a hard decision for myself and for my family because we were happy there. But I got another offer on the table where I was thinking more far [ahead] than in the moment. To be honest, I didn't expect to be back in the Premier League after two years again. This was not the plan for myself, or for our family. Kelly: So you never wanted to come back? Granit: It's not that I didn't want to, but it wasn't planned. When I moved from Arsenal, I signed a five-year contract at Leverkusen. So everything was planned around what happens after five years. But I always say in football, you never know where you are tomorrow. Kelly: Why did you come back then? Granit: Even the people closest to me were saying: 'Why are you going back to the Premier League to join Sunderland?' I came back because I love the challenge and I had the feeling I need a new challenge. After two years in Germany, where in the first year we won nearly everything... unbeaten in the Bundesliga, won the cup, lost the final of Europa League, which was very painful. I just had the feeling with the owner when I spoke with them - with the club, with the coach - this is the right club for me, because the people are very humble. It's a small city like where I grew up. I just wanted to come back in a reality which I believe is the right direction for myself, for my family. I'm just happy that everything at the moment is going how I wanted it to. Kelly: You must have expected it to go well because otherwise you wouldn't have come here. But has it exceeded your expectations? Granit: The first thing I said to the club was: 'I'm not coming here to play in the Premier League for one year and to go down, because I'm leaving a Champions League club. I'm coming here to to push this project.' Kelly: I find it fascinating, because you must have had other offers to come back to the Premier League... Granit: It was a busy summer to be honest! I'm 33, I spoke with my brother and I said: 'I never have had so many offers!' The summer was very busy because every day someone else came. But I decided for myself - after 20 minutes on the call with the owner - I wanted to go to Sunderland. I was so sure. Xhaka - then Arsenal's captain - stormed down the tunnel after being jeered by home supporters when he was substituted in a match against Crystal Palace Kelly: What was a young Granit Xhaka like? Granit: I was not so easy to handle... Kelly: Why doesn't that surprise me?! Granit: If you ask my mum, I was always active. I had a lot of power, but I was a guy who... I just asked our team-mates two months ago: 'What did you expect before I came?' They expect: 'You're coming here and you are the guy who is very serious and never joking, never laughing.' I said: 'Do I have this picture from outside? Because I'm not like this!' Kelly: What are you like? Granit: I like to be around people. I like to be very open with people. Very straightforward... to joke, to laugh. I'm totally different at home. I'm maybe different on the pitch. And I know a lot of clubs - or a lot of other players - that don't like me on the pitch. Kelly: Do you like that players don't like you on the pitch? That's a compliment, isn't it? Granit: I don't know if it's a compliment. Lutsha [Lutsharel Geertruida]... we played against Leipzig with Leverkusen. I say to him: 'How was it?' He says: Everyone hates you.' And I was like: 'Wow. why?' 'Because you are a guy... you provoke. You speak a lot.' And I say: 'Yeah, because I just want to win.' I'm not here to create friends. I'm here to win. And if I want to win, I demand of myself a lot. And if I demand of myself a lot, I demand from others. So sometimes people take it in a wrong way. It's just [about] winning games and after the game, I think I'm the easiest guy who you can meet. Kelly: Talk to me about your dad as well, because he sounds like he's been a huge influence and he must be incredibly proud because he hasn't had it easy. Granit: I will be always thankful for my parents because they grew up in ex-Yugoslavia. My dad had not the easiest period of his life when he was three years sitting in a prison because of politics. Just after meeting my mum, he went in jail for three and half years. When he came out of the situation, there were two options - to catch him again, or to leave the country. My parents [made] the most of it and they came [to Switzerland] with nothing, brought both of their sons through the right direction without any big problems and just giving us a respect, giving us the discipline and just the hard work and the mentality to be humble and to respect everyone. Kelly: How would your best friends describe you? Granit: I'm a very humble guy. I need to help people a lot. I always say to my missus or to my parents and brother: 'I don't need anything. I just need you guys to be happy.' I just want to see the smile on their face. I deal with myself alone because even when I had the problems with the Arsenal fans, I never ever put my family in this part of darkness, because I had dark nights. I had dark days. But I never spoke about this with anybody because this is myself, this is my story and I decided to go in this professional part of football. Xhaka joined Sunderland for an initial Â£13m fee with the potential for Â£4m in add-ons Kelly: How do you deal with the dark moments? How did you deal with that moment at Arsenal? Granit: Very difficult. The worst time I had was always when I was alone, before the game in the hotel or when my missus or my family were not around. Every time these things came up and I just wanted to deal with it alone - looking to myself and say: 'Why has this happened? Why is it me? What did I do wrong to the people?' I was the captain of the football club in this time. But there were too many noises and voices outside - even from players I didn't expect to speak about this. But I believe in life... everything comes back and I'm sitting here very happy and I just want to enjoy my time. Kelly: I always ask in these interviews what people are proudest of, but your resurgence at Arsenal and the way you came back from all of that must be one of the things that you're proudest of? Granit: Absolutely. You can believe me or not... I didn't come back to show people that I'm still the right man for the football club, because in this moment, I didn't care about this. I just wanted to show myself that I can do it. I get a lot of messages, even for people who were speaking bad about me. For me, this is not interesting because football can change from today and tomorrow. That's why I always say to myself, even we have this hype with Sunderland, just stay humble and don't forget where you came from because this can change very quick. Kelly: Tell me one thing about Granit Xhaka that might surprise me. Granit: I hate to be alone - maybe because of my football career and the moments where I had dark nights. So if my family are not around, if my wife or my kids are not at home, I don't sleep in the bedroom. I can't sleep in the bedroom because I feel like I'm alone. Kelly: Where do you sleep? Granit: I sleep in the living room. Kelly: What is one thing that people get wrong about you the most? Granit: They think I'm a little bit arrogant because I'm very straightforward and very honest. If I need to say something, I will tell you in the face good and bad things. Maybe people take as arrogance. But I grew up like this because I hate if something happened behind your back. Kelly: If you could only achieve one more thing in your career, what would it be? Granit: Everything I achieve today, it was a big dream and I achieved maybe much more than God wanted for me. And I'm very, very, thankful that first of all, I'm healthy, had healthy people around me, and in the future, I'm not thinking about what happened in one year. I just think what happens tomorrow. Kelly: So you don't look too far ahead any more. Has that changed throughout your career? Granit: This has changed a lot, yes. Kelly: Because of what you've experienced? Granit: Yes.

49,BBC,Uber ordered to pay $8.5m over claim driver raped passenger,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5y5w148p5o,"A US court has ordered Uber to pay $8.5m (£6.2m) to a woman who said she was raped by a man driving for the ride-share company in a legal ruling that could influence the outcome of thousands of other cases against the company. The federal lawsuit was heard in Arizona, where a jury deliberated for two days, before finding that Uber was responsible for the driver's behaviour. Uber said it intended to appeal against the verdict. The jury rejected additional claims made in the lawsuit, including that Uber had been negligent and that its safety systems were defective. The plaintiff, Jaylynn Dean, said she was sexually assaulted in the car, while taking an Uber to her hotel in 2023. She said Uber had been aware of a wave of sexual assaults committed by its drivers but had not taken basic action to improve safety. The jury found the company was liable under the apparent agency doctrine - meaning Uber was held responsible for the driver's actions while he worked on the company's behalf - resulting in the $8.5m in compensatory damages. It did not back Dean's claim for more than $144m in punitive damages against the firm. A lead lawyer for Dean said the decision ""validates the thousands of survivors who have come forward at great personal risk"". Attorney Sarah London added that justice would ""ultimately be measured by the outcomes of the ongoing litigation and whether meaningful safety reforms are implemented to protect passengers going forward"". Dean's lawsuit was among the first in a selection of 20 so-called ""bellwether"" cases against Uber set to go to trial one after another. These are expected to set some precedent for decisions in roughly 2,500 other federal court cases in which plaintiffs are making similar claims against Uber. Another of Dean's lawyers, Alexandra Walsh, said in court that Uber had marketed itself as a safe option for women travelling alone at night. ""Women know it's a dangerous world. We know about the risk of sexual assault,"" Walsh said. ""They made us believe that this was a place that was safe from that."" Uber had argued that it should not be held liable for criminal acts by drivers using its platform, who it says are independent contractors and are subject to background checks as part of the vetting procedure. Its lawyers said the incident had not been foreseeable, as the driver in question had strong ratings by passengers and no criminal record. ""The jury rejected claims that Uber was negligent and that our safety systems were defective,"" a spokesperson for the firm said. ""They awarded an amount far below what was sought, and declined to award punitive damages altogether. ""This verdict affirms that Uber acted responsibly and has invested meaningfully in rider safety."" The spokesperson for Uber added that in an earlier such case, in which a woman claimed her driver groped and kissed her, the company was not found liable for the assault."
50,BBC,Amazon shares fall as it joins Big Tech AI spending spree,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c150e144we3o,"Amazon has announced plans to invest $200bn (£147.7bn) in artificial intelligence (AI) and infrastructure, becoming the latest US tech giant to set out a sharp rise in spending. It dwarfs the $125bn Amazon spent on AI last year, and appeared to rattle investors. Shares were down nearly 9% in morning trade on Friday, after the company revealed its plans. This week Big Tech's major players - Amazon, Meta, Google, and Microsoft - collectively announced they will this year plough $650bn into AI and related projects However, some high profile names in finance and technology have warned that AI is at risk of becoming a bubble which could burst. As Amazon, which was founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, set out its full-year results on Thursday, it said it will invest in ""AI, chips, robotics and low earth orbit satellites"". Amazon's chief executive, Andy Jassy, was clear on a call with financial analysts that the bulk of its spending will go towards AI. ""It's an unusual opportunity,"" Jassy said of AI, suggesting it will become profitable in the future. ""I passionately believe every customer experience we have today will be reinvented by AI. We're going to invest aggressively,"" Jassy added. However, investors are concerned about the scale of spending on AI and when companies will start to see a return. Like Amazon, the likes of Meta and Microsoft also saw their share prices fall this week, dragging down the wider market. Mary Therese Barton, chief investment officer at Pictet Asset Management, told the BBC there were ""certainly jitters"". She said: ""It has definitely been a bit of a rupture and a bit of a wake up call as well, in terms of 'are these investments in AI going to come good?'."" Late last year, the Bank of England warned that major tech firms could face a ""sharp correction"" in their valuations, saying share prices in the US are reminiscent of those before the dotcom bubble burst in the early 2000s. The boss of US tech giant Cisco told the BBC that the transition to AI will create winners, but warned there will be ""carnage along the way"". Chuck Robbins said the technology will be ""bigger than the internet"", but the current market is probably a bubble and some companies ""won't make it"". And Jamie Dimon, boss of one of America's biggest banks, JPMorgan Chase, said some of the money invested in AI would ""probably be lost"". Brian Olsavsky, Amazon's chief financial officer, noted that the company was looking at cost reductions elsewhere as it ramps up spending. Last week, Amazon laid off another 16,000 workers after cutting 14,000 roles in October. Leaders of other companies joining the AI rush have struck a similar tone. Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg said in January the company will spend up to $135bn this year, nearly double last year's amount. The Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp owner is working on training its AI models, building out data centres and buying the computer chips that are required to operate AI tools. But Zuckerberg also pointed to the use of AI by technical workers, saying that fewer people are now needed on big projects. He predicted ""2026 to be the year that AI dramatically changes the way we work."" Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said his firm will invest even more than Meta on AI, more than doubling its capital expenditure to $185bn this year. The company is expanding its technical infrastructure related to AI, including servers and data centres. While Microsoft did not say exactly how much it will spend over the year, it has so far spent over $72bn on recruiting talent and infrastructure related to AI, while executives have made no mention of pulling back spending. The S&P 500 stock index, which hit an all-time high at the end of January, fell by more than 1% on Thursday, its third day in a row of losses. The index was up almost 1% in morning trade on Friday. More than 900 Google employees signed a letter opposing company links to federal immigration actions.

51,BBC,TikTok told to change 'addictive design' by EU or face massive fines,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr7j7n315lmo,"The EU has told TikTok it must change its ""addictive design"" or face heavy fines, after it found the video sharing platform had breached its online safety rules. It follows an investigation which began in February 2024 into the Chinese-owned app by the European Commission. In its preliminary findings, the Commission said TikTok did not ""adequately assess"" how features like autoplay could harm the wellbeing of its users, including children, and said it failed to implement measures to mitigate the risks. A TikTok spokesperson told the BBC the findings presented a ""categorically false and entirely meritless depiction of our platform"" and it planned to challenge them. The platform has been invited to respond to the EU's findings. Depending on the outcome of this step, the Commission could fine TikTok up to 6% of its total global annual turnover - estimated to be in the tens of billions. EU tech chief Henna Virkkunen told reporters if TikTok wanted to avoid being fined, it would have to ""change the design of their service in Europe"". The Commission gave several suggestions for actions the platform could take, including implementing ""screen time breaks"" when people are using it at night and changing its algorithms, which feed users personalised content. It also suggested TikTok disable so-called ""infinite scroll"", which allows people to quickly cycle through millions of videos on the platform. ""The Digital Services Act makes platforms responsible for the effects they can have on their users,"" Virkkunen said. ""In Europe, we enforce our legislation to protect our children and our citizens online."" Professor Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics said while TikTok had introduced some tools to improve the online safety of its users, it was not enough to comply with the guidelines set down by the EU. ""Young people are calling for such changes,"" she said. ""They are frustrated that the platform does not prioritise their wellbeing over profit."" And social media expert Matt Navarra said while the use of the word addictive was ""often abused"" in these debates, the Commission's findings seemed to be rooted in ""true behavioural science"". He added it marked a ""seismic shift"" in the way in which regulators were looking at social media platforms. ""This seems to be the first time a major regulator has said that the design is the problem,"" he said. ""It's no longer about just toxic content, it's about toxic design."" It is not the first time the EU has looked into the workings of big tech firms or threatened them with fines. In December 2024 it began a separate investigation into TikTok over alleged foreign interference during the Romanian presidential elections. It has also launched an inquiry in January into Elon Musk's X over concerns its AI tool Grok was used to create sexualised images of real people. Meanwhile in December 2025 the EU fined X €120m (£105m) over its blue tick badges, saying they ""deceive users"" because the firm is not ""meaningfully verifying"" who is behind the account. Social media analyst Paolo Pescatore said the latest announcement was a ""reality check"" for TikTok - and a ""warning shot"" for every social media platform. ""The market is shifting from 'maximise engagement' to 'engineer responsibility' - and regulators now have the tools to enforce it,"" he said.

52,BBC,Bitcoin falls to lowest level since Trump took office,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy09x24q0pro,"The price of Bitcoin fell to its lowest level in 16 months despite US president Donald Trump's personal and public support for cryptocurrency. A single Bitcoin went as low as $60,000 (£44,000), its lowest level since September 2024, before rallying slightly. The drop followed months of surging Bitcoin prices, which saw the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high of $122,200 in October 2025. ""Those who bet too big, borrowed too much or assumed prices only go up are now finding out the hard way what real market volatility and risk management look like,"" Joshua Chu, co-chair of the Hong Kong Web3 Association told Reuters. Investors were encouraged by Trump's involvement in the sector and his outspoken support for cryptocurrencies, as well as promises to ease legislation on the industry. With Thursday's drop, Bitcoin prices are down 32% in the last 12 months and are trending toward prices seen in early 2024 and 2021. Bitcoin is the world's largest and generally most well-known cryptocurrency, a form of digital-only money that is not controlled by a centralised financial institution. According to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), around 8% of UK adults were investing in crypto in 2025 - a drop of 4% from the year before. But it said the typical amount of money held by individuals had now increased - with one in five holding between £1,000 and £5,000 in the digital currencies. Among Trump's first actions upon re-entering the White House in January 2025 was an executive order aimed at making the US the ""crypto capital of the planet"". In his first year back in office, Trump launched a personal brand of cryptocurrency, with the bulk of profits going into his own companies. And he continued his involvement with World Liberty Financial, an investment vehicle for other crypto assets that is owned by the Trump family. During the Trump administration so far, he has signed a law to support federal backing of cryptocurrency, dissolved a Department of Justice team focused on enforcement of crypto regulation, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has dropped crypto-related enforcement work and investigations. Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee in November called out Trump's ""pro-crypto agenda"", noting that the president had amassed crypto holdings worth more than $11bn and gained personal income of $800mn from crypto transactions since taking office. Bitcoin prices tend to be volatile, but analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note on Wednesday that the latest drop was ""triggered by"" Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh, as the new chair of the Federal Reserve. Some believe he will take a more ""hawkish"" approach, keeping interest rates higher, whereas looser monetary policy tends to support investment in assets such as crypto currencies. Bitcoin prices have been trending down for the last four months, Deutsche noted, and there has been growing negative sentiment around cryptocurrency more broadly. ""This steady selling in our view signals that traditional investors are losing interest, and overall pessimism about crypto is growing,"" it said. While Deutsche does not expect crypto to disappear, it also did not predict Bitcoin would return to Trump-driven highs. The bank said the digital token was moving from being a ""purely speculative asset"" into a more realistic phase as an asset that ""needs to find its specific role"". William Barhydt, chief executive of Abra Capital Management, an investment firm focused on crypto assets, agreed that cryptocurrency is maturing, but he expects prices to rebound. ""I wouldn't say that it has to rebound, but I can't see how it doesn't,"" Barhydt said, noting that this is not the first time Bitcoin has seen significant swings in value. ""The only way it doesn't is if we end up in some kind of war,"" Barhydt added. Other popular cryptocurrencies are Ethereum and Solana. Their prices have both dropped roughly 37% so far in 2026. According to CoinGecko, which tracks the performance of thousands of cryptocurrencies, the market has lost over $1 trillion in value in the last month alone and $2 trillion in value since the market peaked in October. Stifel, a US-based investment and research firm, said in a note to investors that Bitcoin prices may drop as low as $38,000. The firm pointed to a new trend of cryptocurrency more closely following the prices of the US Dollar. Last week, the dollar dropped to its lowest point in four years. The order did not specify the rate that could be imposed, but used 25% as an example. Some desperate Iranians want US intervention, but others worry that it would not achieve the peace protesters ultimately want.

53,BBC,UK's £8bn research fund faces 'hard decisions' as it pauses new grants,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e50x1r237o,"The boss of UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), the public body which spends £8bn of taxpayer money each year on research and innovation in the UK, has warned the organisation faces ""hard decisions"" on funding future projects. In an open letter, Ian Chapman said the government had told it to ""focus and do fewer things better"", which ""will result in negative outcomes for some"". It represents a major reorganisation of the way Britain's scientific research and innovation is prioritised and funded with public money, and has angered many in the research community. Chapman said the changes have not yet been finalised, but he expected them to be fully implemented by April 2027. In a later briefing, he declined to explain how research projects would be selected in the future. But he said overall, the money available to researchers was set to increase with ""more emphasis on commercialisation"". Funding for what UKRI describes as ""curiosity driven"" research, which Chapman said the UK is ""really good at"", is to remain at the same level - effectively a decrease in real terms as time goes on. In the past this has included studying blood clot detection, plastic-eating enzymes and how babies learn. ""When you make choices some will miss out, but if you don't make choices everybody loses out,"" Chapman said. UKRI is made up of eight separate research councils, which have various disciplines including medicine and biotechnology. One of them is the Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC), which is responsible for research into topics such as astronomy, computational science, and nuclear physics. It currently pays the UK's membership to the Switzerland-based laboratory Cern and the European Space Agency, and it also supports and operates some of the world's biggest telescopes. It has been instructed to find £162m in savings. ""The STFC was extremely ambitious in what it wanted to do and the funding isn't there,"" said its executive chair Michele Dougherty. She said there were no plans to withdraw from existing international commitments. And she added it was too early to say whether the council would fund any new projects in the next couple of years - but did suggest if it did, it would be at the expense of something it is currently supporting. Other councils have also paused grants for new research. ""The UK punches above its weight in scientific impact and in space-related industry,"" said Chris Lintott, professor of astrophysics at Oxford University. ""This should be a national success story but instead we are facing the possibility of unsettling and destabilising threats to funding for cutting edge science."" The changes have also impacted Innovate UK, which supports small and medium sized businesses with grants and advice. The BBC understands local business advisors have been laid off, and those left have been instructed not take on any new ""clients"" – science and tech businesses seeking funding and guidance. ""In the past we have supported thousands of start-ups with small amounts of money,"" said Chapman. ""We are now seeking to support fewer companies."" He did not explain how those firms would be selected, but said they would receive more support as there would be fewer chosen. In the commercial sector, around 75% of businesses which receive private funding from venture capitalists fail. It is notoriously difficult to identify those which will succeed early on. ""Reducing budgets and staffing for small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) support at Innovate UK is the opposite of what our domestic start-up and entrepreneur community needs,"" said Stephen Tulip, UK manager of the App Association. ""Cutting access to expertise and funding for UK SMEs will harm the UK's growth agenda and force start-ups to look elsewhere for investment and support."" Mike Griffin, who founded a sustainable 3D printing company with the help of Innovate UK, agreed. ""For small companies, early-stage backing is the bridge to market,"" he said. ""If support shifts toward bigger, later-stage winners, many practical, life-changing innovations won't survive long enough to scale.""

54,BBC,What it takes to survive on the Moon,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20260202-the-skills-that-could-take-you-to-the-moon,"When the Artemis mission lands on the Moon in years to come, its crew will have to grapple with a challenging environment and extreme isolation. What will it take to thrive in a lonely Moon base? ""Space is really challenging,"" says Nasa astronaut Victor Glover. ""It's harder than it looks, and we don't say that often enough."" I spoke to him just before the Starliner spacecraft's ill-fated mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Later, when the capsule's thruster system failed during docking, the crew was left stuck in space for eight months. Which rather proves Glover's point. The astronaut will soon take the controls of Artemis II, piloting the first crewed Orion capsule beyond the Moon – further than humans have ever gone before. For 10 days, Glover will live in a small pressurised compartment with his three companions. He does not take his responsibilities lightly. ""We have a tank full of water, and as we drink that water, it's gone,"" he says. ""We have food, and as we eat the food, it's gone – no one's sending a resupply ship."" Even the simplest daily activities will become a challenge, and potential annoyance. ""There's no such thing as privacy,"" he says. ""You can go into the waste and hygiene compartment and shut the door and as soon as you flip the machine on, you wake everybody up – it's the loudest thing other than the engine."" ""These are the things that are going to require a different set of psychological preparations."" Artemis II is the first step in humanity's eventual return to the Moon. Future US-led missions will land humans on the lunar surface and construct a base near its South Pole. Astronauts will be days away from Earth, living for months in confinement with only their colleagues for company. With nights that last two weeks, outside it will be dusty and airless with extreme temperatures and potentially damaging levels of radiation. Trips to the Moon are going to be both physically and mentally demanding, and it's crucial to find the right people for the job. ""It's very difficult to select an astronaut because you're not looking for superhumans in any one domain,"" says Sergi Vaquer Araujo, who leads the space medicine team at the European Space Agency (Esa) and will help oversee astronaut selection for future lunar missions. ""You're looking for someone good in all domains – and that is dramatically difficult to find."" When Nasa selected its first astronauts in the 1950s, the candidates were all test pilots at the peak of physical fitness. During selection, these men (and they were all men) had to endure weeks of tests – covering everything from lung capacity to eyesight, bowel movements to sperm count. Those that emerged were said to have ""the right stuff."" Today's astronauts are no longer required to be as exceptionally fit, but they do still need to meet certain physical criteria. ""Any kind of chronic sickness that impedes function during the mission would be disqualifying,"" says Vaquer Araujo. So, although short-sightedness might be acceptable, lung conditions (such as asthma), heart irregularities or colour blindness can rule out even the best qualified. ""It's important to understand that we're on an exploration mission and we don't have the medical equipment we have on the ground,"" Vaquer Araujo says. ""To reduce risk, we have to have well-screened people – if you had an asthma attack in the middle of the mission then we wouldn't be able to treat that."" While that might rule out many potential candidates (this reporter included), most reasonably fit people have a good chance of passing the physical. But that is only the start of what the ""right stuff"" means today. Much of the selection process is about assessing cognitive abilities and psychological suitability for space missions. The first astronauts were hyper-competitive winners – ""alpha males"" – ready to put their lives on the line. It made them exciting people to be around but not necessarily spend too much time in a confined space with. Today, being able to work well with others is one of the most important attributes of an astronaut. It is not necessarily an advantage to win. During Esa's most recent astronaut selection process, candidates were observed during team challenges. ""The success of the team was more important than personal success,"" says Vaquer Araujo. ""It got to the stage where, to succeed, you had to lose for the benefit of the team."" Another way to discover if you have what it takes to make it on the Moon is to try living at the ends of the Earth. British surgeon Nina Purvis has recently returned from the French Italian Concordia research station in Antarctica. Selected as part of an Esa research programme, she spent the whole winter with just 12 other people. ""It's called 'White Mars' because it's an isolated, confined and extreme environment,"" says Purvis. ""During the polar night there's no sunlight and it can reach around -80C (-112F) each day. ""From February to November the station is completely isolated, so we have to be autonomous in terms of food, fuel and medical care,"" she says. ""If somebody gets ill there's me and a more senior doctor in emergency medicine and we would work together to treat any patient."" Fortunately, emergencies at Concordia are rare, and Purvis spent most of her time conducting experiments – some on her companions. As well as research including how gut health fares in an isolated community, several of the studies concerned mental wellbeing. Anyone chosen to work in Antarctica will have undergone a similar selection process to astronauts, so investigating how to improve their mood and resilience can help inform future space missions. ""You have to be a pleasant person to work with, that's number one,"" Purvis says. ""You have to deal with pressure, stress and uncertainty and still be able to perform in your job – you can train for every scenario but something's going to happen that we can't predict."" What has also become apparent from decades of polar research is that while there is occasional excitement, boredom is a serious concern. ""There's not much stimulation here in terms of the environment, so it's very monotonous,"" says Purvis. ""You don't want to sit in your room in the dark and watch Netflix all of the time."" One of Purvis's experiments was on mindfulness. Building on previous research, she would gather the crew together for activities that included yoga, Lego construction and painting. ""We haven't had all the results yet, but I felt it benefitted me, and the team actually looked forward to doing the activities and they brought them together,"" Purvis says. ""And that's the kind of experiment that has a low payload, but a very high reward and I think they will definitely implement it into astronaut schedules in future."" It's not only space agencies that have been experimenting with Moonbase living. At the height of the Covid pandemic in September 2020 – when many of us were getting fed up with isolating from others – 24-year-old architect Sebastian Aristotelis and his 22-year-old colleague Karl-Johan Sørensen embarked on a mission of their own. Having previously won a competition to design a concept Mars habitat, they decided to build a prototype lunar habitat and live in it for 60 days in northern Greenland. ""We decided we didn't want to do any more of this concept stuff,"" says Aristotelis. ""People already thought we were mad, and I needed to see that we could actually build something to believe that I was not just a crazy dreamer."" More like this: • Artemis: The return of the Moon that will set space records • Why there's a rush to explore the Moon's enigmatic South Pole • The astronaut school inside a Swiss mountain It was only when they were being dropped off by the Danish Navy that Aristotelis began to have doubts. ""I saw the little dot of land in this barren landscape and that was the first time I realised what we had signed up for,"" he says. ""All the cheering and excitement just fizzled out, and it was just this completely quiet moment… feeling nervousness and a little bit of anxiety for the first time."" Built from carbon fibre and covered in solar panels, the prefabricated Lunark Moon base was designed to unfold like origami but had to be strong enough to withstand any polar bear attacks (obviously not an issue on the Moon). Although it was only a couple of metres wide, the habitat was fitted with three interior compartments stacked on top of each other so the companions could have their own private space. An estate agent might describe it as cosy. They also developed an interior lighting system to simulate daylight and keep circadian rhythms in check. ""The first day was so claustrophobic, there was so much equipment that we were standing up in this tiny capsule,"" says Aristotelis. ""Then after days of getting settled, we got into a routine and all of a sudden, because outside was so extreme and scary, the inside very quickly became a home."" As a result of the experiment, Aristotelis's business Saga now operates in two continents working for space agencies and companies to design lunar habitats and space station interiors. ""I think about the mission every day,"" he says. ""If you're going to design a house on the Moon, you need to try very hard to get an experience similar to what it would be like with all the small annoyances and problems that you can then find solutions for."" Glover, meanwhile, has spent years training for Nasa's return to the Moon and may one day even find himself living there. I ask him if he is psychologically prepared for leaving Earth so far behind? ""I don't know,"" he says.

55,BBC,Treasures found on HS2 route stored in secret warehouse,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93v21q5xdvo,"Treasures unearthed by hundreds of archaeologists during the ongoing construction of the controversial HS2 train line have been shown exclusively to the BBC. The 450,000 objects, which are being held in a secret warehouse, include a possible Roman gladiator's tag, a hand axe that may be more than 40,000 years old and 19th Century gold dentures. It is an ""unprecedented"" amount and array of items, which will yield new insights into Britain's past, says the Centre for British Archaeology. Major building developments in the UK need land to be assessed by archaeologists as part of the planning process, to protect heritage sites. Since 2018 around 1,000 archaeologists have been involved in 60 digs along the route HS2 is set to take between London to Birmingham. While the route is not currently scheduled to open until after 2033 due to delays, archaeologists say their fieldwork is largely complete. The warehouse's location is a closely guarded secret for security purposes. All we can say is that it is in Yorkshire. Inside are shelves and shelves of pallets, loaded with around 7,300 boxes of historic items destined for further research. The future of many objects, including whether they will stay in storage or be displayed, is still undecided, along with their ownership. Historic England commended the team for revealing ""new and exciting sites spanning over 10,000 years of our past"". But building HS2 has changed the landscape along its route, cutting into fields and communities, and dividing opinion. Critics, such as Greg Smith, MP for Mid Buckinghamshire, say soaring costs, delays, abandoned villages and damage to the natural and historic environment mean that it is not worth building. ""It should not have cost the taxpayer tens of billions of pounds to build a railway that no-one wants and brings so much destruction,"" Smith says. HS2 said in response: ""Chief Executive Mark Wild has been clear that overall delivery of HS2 has been unacceptable and he's committed to ending the project's cycle of cost increases and delays."" ""Our specialist archaeology team and contractors have carefully excavated numerous sites and have shown care and respect throughout this work."" ""Whether HS2 is a good or bad thing is debatable, but I tell you what, if they built the railway and they didn't do the archaeology that would be more tragic,"" said historian Graham Evans, who chairs the Northamptonshire Battlefields Society. The store holds showstoppers such as Roman statue heads and a gold 'three lions' pendant from the 13th-14th Century. On the ground in one area is a bubble-wrapped empty coffin dating to 1799, with a smaller one next to it wrapped in masking tape - sobering reminders that this store is a snapshot of real lives once lived. Some of the objects discovered have already been shown to the public. We have picked out six that have never been on display. You can see where they were found on the HS2 route map below - then scroll further down to see the objects and read about their history. Experts think this is more than 40,000 years old and was made by Neanderthals or an earlier species of human. Found in the Edgcote area in Northamptonshire, it has a sharp edge likely designed for butchering animals. Hand axes were held in the palm rather than attached to a wooden handle. ""There is something tactile about it when you hold it,"" said Dr Sara Machin, the finds lead for Access +, the consortium of archaeologists in charge of this project. ""Even now it fits snugly in my hand."" The small piece of carved thin bone bears an inscription. Experts would expect it to read if complete: ""DOMINE VICTOR VINCAS FELIX"" or ""Lord Victor, may you win and be lucky."" Discovered in Northamptonshire, Machin says it could have belonged to an active or  former Roman gladiator, or even be a spectator's souvenir, even though there is no evidence of an arena or circus space in that part of the country. It was recovered from a large pottery vessel containing cremated human remains, with an X on the lid. Dr John Pearce Reader in Archaeology at Kings College University said that a link to a gladiator was possible, but added that ""with more forensic analysis of the burial, a different story may come to light"". Thought to be made from a cattle femur, this decorated Anglo-Saxon spindle whorl,  used to provide weight while spinning yarn, was unearthed from farmland near Bishopstone, Buckinghamshire. ""It's a very interesting piece of evidence of textile advancements in the Anglo-Saxon period,"" said Willow Major, a post-excavation assistant. Its polished surface leads her to believe it got a lot of use and was very dear to someone, she said, adding that interestingly, the ring and dot motif had been found on spinning tools from the much earlier Iron age. A tiny polished die recovered from a deserted medieval village in Lower Radbourne, Warwickshire, resembles modern ones, but with a different numbering format. Its imperfections, with one side longer than the others, stand it in contrast with today's mass-produced dice. This complete figurine of a seated pug dog in plain white-glazed porcelain with black details was found in the grave of an unnamed female at St James' Gardens in Euston. It is thought to have been made in the Derby porcelain factory around 1770-1800. ""Every box has a surprise,"" Machin said as she unwrapped perhaps the most bizarre item here, thought to be from the 19th Century: a set of lower gold dentures found at St Mary's Old Church in Stoke Mandeville. It contains six teeth and has a number stamped on the inside. ""These are objects, but they all relate to people,"" Machin said. ""It's all about the people who lived in these areas going back thousands of years and we can start writing the stories about their lives and what they can tell us."" ""The scale is what makes it so extraordinary,"" Neil Redfern from the Council for British Archaeology says comparing HS2 to other big development projects. ""But it is the length of the scheme and the landscapes and places that HS2 passed through that make the collection of sites and material so interesting. The research potential from this material is remarkable."" He believes that the finds could help people understand wider landscape change now and in the past. To dig deeper into these stories, archaeologists are now entering the second phase of works, including further condition, cleaning and conservation checks. More plans are afoot to show the objects. Artefacts from the Wendover Saxon cemetery, where 122 graves were unearthed, will soon go on display for the first time at a Discover Bucks Museum exhibition. However, the future of other items is less clear. A spokesperson for HS2 explained that under English property law, archaeological and historical objects found during the works will either belong to the government or landowners. ""Occasionally landowners may wish to retain title to objects, in which case they will be returned to their care,"" said the spokesperson. Charlotte Self, archive manager for the project said she and her team were asking landowners to donate them where possible, so people around the route could enjoy them. ""I would love to see the majority of these items deposited with the local museums from near where they were found,"" she said.

56,BBC,"Polar bears on Norwegian islands fatter and healthier despite ice loss, scientists say",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l1xpz03no,"Scientists expected the opposite, but polar bears in the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s, all while sea ice has steadily declined due to climate change. Polar bears rely on sea ice as a platform from which to hunt the seals that they rely on for blubber-rich meals. The bears' fat reserves provide energy and insulation and allow mothers to produce rich milk for cubs. Researchers weighed and measured 770 adults in Svalbard between 1992 and 2019 and found that bears had become significantly fatter. They think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by eating more land-based prey, including reindeer and walruses. The discovery, published in Scientific Reports, was particularly puzzling because of the impact of climate change in Svalbard. During the same period that this research was carried out, global temperature rise has increased the number of ice-free days per year in the region by almost 100 - at a rate of about four days each year. ""The fatter a bear is the better it is,"" explained lead researcher Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute. ""And I would have expected to see a decline in body condition when the loss of sea ice has been so profound."" Walruses have been officially protected in Norway since the 1950s, after they were hunted to near extinction. That protection has boosted their numbers, and apparently provided a new source of fatty food for polar bears. ""There are a lot more walruses around [for them to hunt] these days,"" said Aars. ""It is also possible that they are able to hunt seals more efficiently."" He explained that, if seals have smaller areas of sea ice available to them, they will  congregate in those smaller areas, presenting easier collective pickings for bears. While this is unexpected good news for these Arctic predators, the researchers think it is unlikely to last. As the sea ice continues to decline, bears will have to travel further to access hunting grounds, using more energy and depleting precious fat reserves. The charity Polar Bears International points out that Svalbard's polar bears were some of the most heavily-hunted in the world, until international protections were introduced in the 1970s. Experts think the new findings could be linked to the population recovering from that hunting pressure. That, combined with an increase in the number of walruses - and of reindeer - in recent decades, appears to have provided the bears with a temporary boost. Dr John Whiteman, chief research scientist at PBI said the results were ""positive in the short term"". ""But body condition is only one piece of the puzzle. Other recent research on these bears found that more ice-free days reduced survival in cubs and in subadult and old females."" Elsewhere in the Arctic, climate change is having a very different effect on polar bears. There are 20 known sub-populations of polar bears across the Arctic. In Canada's Western Hudson Bay, where the most southerly and best studied bears live, a decline in the population has been directly linked to warming temperatures. Whiteman added that that the long-term picture for polar bears was clear - they need sea ice to survive. ""Ice loss ultimately means bear declines, but [this study shows] that the short-term picture can be very region-specific."" ""In the long term,"" he told BBC News, ""if ice loss continues unchecked, we know the bears will eventually disappear."" The only Januarys wetter than this year's were in 1939, 1995 and 2014, meteorologists say. Volunteers with Ipswich Umbrella will hold craftivism sessions and a repair cafe from a climate hub.

57,BBC,Why Wuthering Heights is 2026's most divisive film,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20260205-how-wuthering-heights-became-this-years-most-divisive-film,"Ever since it was announced, Emerald Fennell's version of the torrid Brontë classic has been the subject of furious online discourse over everything from its casting to its costumes. The most controversial film of the year? Usually that accolade is reserved for an edgy political thriller or a taboo-busting horror movie. But the film that is currently prompting the most ""discourse"" – to use a polite term for it – is an adaptation of a 19th-Century novel. Ever since Emerald Fennell declared that she was following Promising Young Woman and Saltburn with her own take on Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights, commentators have not been short of opinions – mostly negative ones. ""Fennell has channelled her creative instincts into a disturbing exercise in pointless destruction,"" wrote Lara Brown in The Spectator – and that was five months before the film's release date next week. Everything about the film has been pilloried, from its casting to its costumes, from the actors' accents to the inverted commas around the title: it's ""Wuthering Heights"", not Wuthering Heights, to emphasise that this is Fennell's own interpretation of the book, rather than the book itself. The hostility has been relentless. But could the reasons for this hostility go beyond some scepticism about a dodgy-looking period drama? The first objections were heard in July 2024, when the news broke that someone known for provocative and flashy satires was adapting a revered Victorian classic. Having been a film and television actress, Fennell wrote and directed two hits, Promising Young Woman and Saltburn – with the former winning the Oscar for best screenplay in 2021. But both films suffered backlashes. Fennell was accused of dealing in style-over-substance trash which appeared to tackle serious subjects – sexual assault, class war – only to fall back on snazzy colour schemes, cheap twists and pop hit-soundtracked memes. The worry seemed to be that Fennell's Brontë adaptation would be more of the same. The volume of objections increased in September 2024 when Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi were confirmed as the book's main characters, Cathy and Heathcliff. In the section of Brontë's novel which covers their intense romance, Cathy and Heathcliff are in their teens, whereas Robbie and Elordi are now 35 and 28 respectively. Another factor is that Robbie – Barbie herself – has kept her straight blonde hair, rather than having the ""brown ringlets"" mentioned in the novel. More significantly, Heathcliff is said in Wuthering Heights to resemble a ""dark-skinned gipsy"", leading some scholars to propose that he isn't white: for some, it's his non-whiteness that accounts for his being ""othered"" and mistreated in the story. Bearing that in mind, could Fennell be accused of whitewashing the character – and missing the point – by having Elordi as her leading man? The film's casting director, Kharmel Cochrane, wasn't fazed by the negativity. ""There was one Instagram comment that said the casting director should be shot,"" she recalled last April. ""But you really don't need to be accurate. It's just a book. That is not based on real life. It's all art."" That may be so – and it's not as if Robbie and Elordi are the first actors to be older and whiter than the Cathy and Heathcliff imagined by Brontë: Laurence Oliver and Merle Oberon were 32 and 28 when the 1939 film of Wuthering Heights came out. But last year's complaints show how much times have changed. Audiences are a lot more sensitive to whitewashing and inauthenticity than they used to be. Besides, in 2011, Andrea Arnold's Wuthering Heights film had a black actor, James Howson, as Heathcliff, while Kaya Scodelario, who played Cathy, was 19 when it was released. To some, the new film's casting looked like a backwards step – backwards to 1939, to be precise. Then came last August's test screenings. As reported in World of Reel, attendees gave the impression that the story was ""stripped of emotional nuance and full of salacious detours that serve shock value"". These assertions were backed up by the steamy trailer, which went online the following month. Fennell, it seemed, didn't want ""Wuthering Heights"" to be any less garish, modern or sexually frank than Saltburn and Promising Young Woman. In the trailer, Robbie is seen doing some highly suggestive breadmaking, her cheeks flushed and her bodice heaving, as she remembers Elordi's naked torso. Then there are shots of a corset being pulled tight, of Elordi stripping off his shirt, and, errm, someone putting their finger in a fish's mouth. A typical response to all this lust and lewdness was an article in The Spinoff entitled ""Everyone hates the new Wuthering Heights trailer, and here's why"". ""Fennell is taking a piece of art and reducing it to its dullest form"", wrote Clare Mabey. There were plenty of issues aside from the overt eroticism, too. The trailer was aggressively anachronistic, with Charli XCX on the soundtrack, and Cathy wearing a white wedding dress which, according to Vogue, ""seemed as though it was more befitting of the 1980s than the early 1800s"". And when a clip from the film was released last month, the actors themselves were derided for being anachronistic. ""They surely had great dentists back then,"" said one comment on YouTube. ""Love Margot, but she looks like she’s about to pull an iPhone out at any moment,"" said another. But these quibbles raise some big questions, the first one being: So what? Why shouldn't Fennell come up with her own out-there, sexed-up version of Wuthering Heights? If Clueless can put a Jane Austen plot in 1990s California, and Baz Luhrmann's Romeo + Juliet can do the same with Shakespeare, why should we be fussing about dress design? There are two obvious answers, one of them suggested by the fact that, in the trailer, Robbie's Cathy sounded posher than any screen character since, well, the toffs in Saltburn. Fennell's last film, Saltburn, was set in a stately home, and one of the best things about it was that the writer-director seemed to know her upper-class characters intimately. There is no mystery as to how she managed it: as the daughter of celebrated jewellery designer Theo Fennell, she grew up in gilded circles. To quote Patrick Sproull in Dazed, ""Not a lot of 18-year-olds have their birthday party photographed by Tatler and attended by a Delevingne, multiple Guinness heirs, several members of the nobility and the daughter of Sting."" In short, Fennell is posh. Indeed, her background is so privileged that when she acted in The Crown as Camilla Parker-Bowles – now better known as Queen Camilla – she didn't have to sound any grander than she does in ordinary life. This hasn't endeared her to everyone. As popular as Saltburn was, some reviews argued that it was too forgiving of its posh characters because Fennell was so posh herself. ""It's a satire that never bares its claws, never lifts a finger to criticise these people,"" said Sproull. Other people have grumbled that Fennell's connections and advantages gave her directing career an unfair head start. This meant that many commentators were primed to dislike ""Wuthering Heights"" from the very beginning. The antipathy had as much to do with their feelings about Fennell as their feelings about the film. More like this: • Hollywood's worst casting decisions • 10 of the best films to watch in February • 16 of the most exciting films for 2026 But the main reason behind all the rancour is this: people who love Brontë's novel really love Brontë's novel. They're not just fond of it, they're fixated on it. As Hephzibah Anderson wrote in a BBC article, ""Most of us read Wuthering Heights in our teens. In other words, when we're wildly impressionable."" Many of the book's fans go on to view it as part of their identity – and, for that matter, as part of their love lives. ""I remain convinced that the precedent for chasing toxic love stories was one set out for me as a teenager, by Heathcliff,"" confessed Olivia Petter in British Vogue. And she's not alone. Considering how devoted the novel's aficionados are, it was inevitable that any film which diverged from the text would be taken by some as a personal attack. The irony is that Fennell professes to adore the book as much as anyone. At the Brontë Women's Writing Festival last September, she said that she had been ""obsessed"" and ""driven mad"" by Wuthering Heights since she read it as a 14-year-old. ""I know that if somebody else made [the film], I'd be furious."" She's probably not too worried, then, that other people are furious about her. In fact, she may be quite pleased. Every time new information about the film emerges, there are thousands of impassioned words written about it, and while they aren't all flattering, they have undoubtedly helped to raise awareness and build anticipation. Could ""Wuthering Heights"" really be as over-the-top as the trailers suggest, we asked. Could it be so-bad-it's-good? Or could it even be… good? Certainly, social media reactions from an early screening have been strong, with one film writer even moved to declare it a ""god-tier new classic"". ""I personally cannot wait to watch Fennell's Wuthering Heights,"" wrote Olivia Petter in Vogue. ""I'll admit, as a dedicated fan of the book, I was sceptical at first. But now, I no longer care about accuracy.""

58,BBC,'It immerses you in fantasy': Why Bridgerton tourism is booming,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4kg1nk25lo,"After Tehreem Iqbal started watching Bridgerton, she knew she had to travel from Canada to the UK to see the filming locations in real life. ""It was a dream of mine,"" the 31-year-old says. So when Tehreem began planning a trip to England to visit family, she also drew up an itinerary of excursions to visit the places where her favourite show was shot. Since the first episode of Bridgerton came out on Christmas Day 2020, the Regency romantic drama has been a huge hit for Netflix, which lists it as one of its most-viewed shows. The first half of season four, which was released at the end of January, appeared in the streamer's top 10 most-watched shows in 91 countries. Though the show is largely set in London's Mayfair, its main filming locations include Bath, where the Royal Crescent is used for the Featherington home, and Greenwich, where Ranger's House is shot as the home of the eponymous Bridgerton family. The series also uses a smattering of other grand properties across the country, like Castle Howard in Yorkshire, Belton House in Lincolnshire and Wrest Park in Bedfordshire, to demonstrate the opulence of the Georgian upper classes. Fans say they're hooked by the show's aesthetics as much as its storylines, and they told BBC News visiting the filming locations helped them feel part of ""the Ton"" - even if the 21st century traffic and crowds of tourists reduced the regality. Tehreem's visit to Greenwich was ""misty and slightly rainy"", but she didn't care. ""It was a big moment for me to see it in person,"" says the superfan, who has attracted the attention of Bridgerton actress Nicola Coughlan and author Julia Quinn with her artwork of the show. Dive into the Bridgerton corner of Instagram or TikTok and you'll see countless posts from fans posing in front of the Abbey Deli in Bath, which doubles as the Modiste dress shop, or the Old Royal Naval College, the backdrop for various scenes. Much of this content is accompanied by the show's soundtrack and references to Lady Whistledown and the ""gentle reader"". Melissa Maddock has built a following of nearly 800,000 on TikTok by touring filming locations. Visiting Bath ""genuinely felt like stepping into the show"", she says. The 26-year-old from Nottingham says the locations she saw looked ""the exact same as you see in the TV show"", in contrast to other programmes which use ""a lot of set dressing"". When the first episodes of series four came out last month, Alexis Reise Brodman, 27, was awake and ready to watch them when they hit Netflix at 03:00 in New York. And she watched all four episodes again that night, when she hosted a watch party for her friends with finger sandwiches, scones and tea. When Alexis visited the UK last year, she made sure to visit the show's filming locations in Bath and Greenwich. It was ""a little jarring"" to see the car park outside Ranger's House, says Alexis, but she was still ""starstruck"" to be there in real life. Tehreem agrees and, in contrast to content creator Melissa, says some of the locations she visited surprised her in person, telling us Ranger's House looked like a ""normal building"", with buses driving nearby and the rumble of tourists. She says it made her appreciate the show's dressing and post-production work, with the exterior transformed with wisteria and made to look like it was surrounded by other properties. Paul Elliott has been running Bridgerton tours in Bath since 2021. He wasn't that interested in the show when it came out, but as a tour guide who experienced his industry ""crashing and burning"" during the pandemic, he says hearing the first season's viewing figures ""made me wake up and pay attention"". When he first started offering Bridgerton tours, Covid restrictions meant he was limited to groups of six and he had to take customers' temperatures. Since then, he's given tours to people from around the world, he tells BBC News, and even took six Bridgerton fans around the city on Christmas Day. ""I don't think any of us expected quite the phenomenon we've seen around Bridgerton,"" says Seb Conway, general manager of Basildon Park in Berkshire, which was used for the Featheringtons' garden and Lady Tilley Arnold's house. He says people from ""all over the world"" have visited the property because of its Bridgerton link. ""We even had people coming here and getting engaged because it was featured in Bridgerton,"" he says. Seb says it's particularly interesting to see the tweaks the production team makes to the site - such as using artificial flowers in the rose garden for a scene actually filmed in winter, and using props and careful camera shots to hide mirrors that couldn't be taken down. For some people, visiting places where Bridgerton is filmed is about more than just seeing the filming locations with their own eyes. Alia Pyatt, a 31-year-old cosplayer from California, has made her own Bridgerton-inspired Regency dresses and hopes to visit the show's locations in costume this summer. ""It immerses you in that fantasy,"" Alia says, describing it as a form of escapism. She and her friends, also big fans of the show, have cosplayed as Bridgerton characters. As well as dressing up, they also try to replicate the posture, behaviours - such as using a fan - and ""old-world way of speaking"" of the Regency period. Alia's desire to experience and embody the show has been shared by other Bridgerton fans, leading to a boom in Bridgerton-themed experiences and events, including candlelight concerts and balls. London's Lanesborough hotel runs a Bridgerton afternoon tea. ""Aesthetically, it's a very Instagrammable experience,"" says Jo Stevenson, the hotel's head of sales and marketing. Netflix sends the hotel a mood board with the flowers, colours and dresses used in each series to help shape the menu. Netflix and production company Shondaland also sign off every aspect of the experience, down to the names of the cakes and cocktails. Tehreem has attended Bridgerton-themed events in Toronto, where she met other fans of the show and felt ""immersed in Regency world"". But sadly, her visits to the real-life Bridgerton locations haven't yet yielded any sightings of the show being filmed, as she'd hoped. ""I thought I would catch Lady Bridgerton at the Bridgerton House,"" she says, ""but there were no wisteria or carriages to be seen."" Alfie Kiely spent three months in Malaysia while shooting Lord of the Flies, playing one of the ""Littluns"".

59,BBC,Epstein emails raise questions over role of Andrew's palace aide,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w2ywe9e0o,"An aide to Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was asked by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein about arranging a dinner with a ""beautiful friend"" of his, nearly three years after the then-prince claimed to have cut ties, new emails show. ""I have a very beautiful friend comoing [sic] to london on tues. ANdrew might want to have her for a dinner,"" Epstein wrote in October 2013 to David Stern. Emails appear to show Stern, a trusted royal insider, acted as a go-between for the pair after the then-Duke's relationship with Epstein began to receive scrutiny following his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor. Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing. The BBC has tried to contact Stern for comment. No further correspondence confirms whether Mountbatten-Windsor met Epstein's ""friend"". Other emails seen by the BBC suggest that Stern, an enigmatic figure with little online presence, also invited Epstein to a dinner at Windsor Castle in 2017 - nearly a decade after he was convicted of child sex offences. The latest email, released by the US Department of Justice, from Epstein suggesting that ""Andrew"" meet his ""beautiful friend"" is sent three years after he had separately suggested that ""The Duke"" might enjoy having dinner with a 26-year-old Russian woman in August 2010. Correspondence seen by the BBC, released by the DOJ, shows that Stern regularly communicated with Epstein about royal business and personal affairs from at least 2009 to 2017, by which point he was acting as a director of Mountbatten-Windsor's company Pitch@Palace - a Dragons' Den-style start-up competition where entrepreneurs could present their ideas to potential investors. Stern, an investor and German national, resigned as a director of Pitch@Palace in 2019. He was also a director of the St George's House Trust, based in Windsor Castle, from 2016 until 2022. In April 2017, Stern emails Epstein - nearly a decade after his conviction - to say that he was organising a ""super"" dinner at Windsor Castle in May that year, asking ""who else"" he should invite. In another email, dated the same day, Epstein appears to have the power to directly invite another business associate of his to the Windsor dinner, writing: ""I know you hate london do [sic] want a dinner invite at windsor castle with the top Chinese. biz people? may 26"". The recipient asks Epstein if he will be present at the dinner, to which he responds: ""no, I have a havard [sic] event"", potentially implying he was invited but unable to attend. The emails suggest that Epstein continued to have a much more influential and closer relationship with Mountbatten-Windsor and royal residences in the years after the former Duke had claimed to BBC Newsnight to have cut contact with him in December 2010. In 2014, Stern messages Epstein to say that ""PA [Prince Andrew] sends his birthday wishes and love"" alongside a picture of him with the then-Duke and Duchess of York. The message apparently from Stern also wishes Epstein ""Happy Birthday"" and shares a crude photo of champagne being poured down a naked woman, adding: ""Champagne for you (even though you don't drink it)"". He appears to keep in frequent contact with Epstein about his work and access to the Palace, emailing Epstein in 2010 that he was at Prince Andrew's ""birthday party"" and boasting about the famous celebrities he had encountered. Other emails seem to show that Stern had also acted around this time as a conduit between Epstein and Sarah Ferguson, the former Duchess of York. In 2011, emails include one from Stern's account which sent Epstein a message from ""Sarah"" mentioning ""The Duke"", in which she congratulates him on the apparent birth of a ""baby boy"". After the crash of a business venture in 2009, Ferguson also appears to write to Epstein: ""I urgently need 20,000 pounds ($27,521) for rent today"" following an exchange with Stern, which she is copied into. A spokesman for Sarah Ferguson previously told the BBC that she was told to congratulate Epstein on a baby but has no knowledge beyond that. Further emails, as part of the three million published last week, also shed new light on Epstein's apparent invitation to have dinner with ""The Duke"" at Buckingham Palace in 2010, and that the sex offender requested to bring three women along with him. On 27 September that year, Epstein emails ""The Duke"" to say that he is in London and asks what time Mountbatten-Windsor would like him and a woman, who the BBC is not naming. ""The Duke"" suggests they could have ""dinner"" at Buckingham Palace and ""lots of privacy"", to which Epstein agrees, responding that he is with three women. Epstein asks if he should ""bring them all, so as to add some life"", in the email exchanges. ""Yes. Plenty of space here for chat! Bring them,"" says ""The Duke"". In a previous email, sent months prior, Epstein had described one of the women as ""a great friend"" and ""very pretty"" after ""The Duke"" asked who she was. Another email, sent the evening before the dinner, appears to show that Epstein had also personally invited a fourth woman to the Buckingham Palace meet-up, asking if she wanted to join and that she agreed. The BBC has approached Mountbatten-Windsor for comment. He has always denied any wrongdoing arising out of his association with Epstein. The BBC has spent days trying to contact Stern for comment. Many Labour insiders say Sir Keir may not be the man to take them to the next election, writes Laura Kuenssberg. Former Labour Party peer tells sex offender he found ""a great place to stay"" with ""privacy"", a document suggests. Millions of Epstein-related documents released by the US justice department include the names of the world's rich and powerful. Millions of files released this week shed fresh light on the links between Jeffrey Epstein and prominent political and public figures. Mette-Marit says she is sorry to Norwegians for not realising what kind of person the late sex offender was."
60,BBC,"Son of rapper Lil Jon believed dead, days after going missing",https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4grg64l892o,"The son of rapper Lil Jon is believed to have been found dead, days after he went missing from his home in the US state of Georgia, authorities said. Nathan Smith, a rapper who goes by the name DJ Young Slade, was reported missing after police said he ran out of his home early Tuesday without his phone. After days of searching, the Milton Police Department said a body, believed to be Smith, was located in a nearby pond. The Fulton County Medical Examiner's Office was working to provide official confirmation, police said. ""Based on the investigation to date, there is no indication of foul play,"" police said, adding they will continue to examine what led to his death. Grammy-Award winning artist Lil Jon, known for hits like Yeah! and Turn Down For What, provided a statement to BBC News saying he and Smith's mother, Nicole Smith, were ""heartbroken"". ""Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet. He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted,"" Lil Jon said in the statement. ""We loved Nathan with all of our hearts and are incredibly proud of him. He was loved and appreciated, and in our last times together we're comforted in knowing that we expressed that very sentiment to him."" Police said they were contacted about Smith's disappearance on Tuesday morning after the 27-year-old left his home under ""unusual circumstances"". An initial missing person poster released by authorities specified that Smith left his house on foot and ""may be disoriented and in need of assistance"". Family and friends were concerned for his safety, it added. The pond where the body was discovered Friday morning was not far from Smith's residence in Milton, a city 30 miles (48 km) north of Atlanta, where his father Lil Jon made his music career. Lil Jon and Smith were frequently pictured together, including last year when the two competed on an episode of the television game show Family Feud. ""He was an amazingly talented young man; a music producer, an artist and engineer, and graduate of NYU,"" Lil Jon wrote in his statement. No more information will be released until medical examiners can determine a cause and manner of death, police said. Meet the fans travelling the world to see their hero Robbie Williams in concert.

61,BBC,Why Wuthering Heights is so misunderstood,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20260202-why-wuthering-heights-is-so-misunderstood,"Ever since it was published in the mid-19th Century, Emily Brontë's tale of passionate love and ruthless revenge has captivated fans and confounded critics in equal measure. Authored by one ""Ellis Bell"", Wuthering Heights was met with rather mixed reviews when it was first published in 1847. Some were scathing, horrified by its ""brutal cruelty"" and portrayal of a ""semi-savage love"". Others acknowledged the book's ""power and cleverness"", ""its delineation forcible and truthful"". Many said it was simply ""strange"". Despite the popularity of gothic fiction at the time, it's perhaps unsurprising that Wuthering Heights shocked readers in the 19th Century, a time of strict moral scrutiny. ""People did not know what to do with this book, because it has no clear moral angle,"" says Clare O'Callaghan, senior professor of Victorian literature at Loughborough University in the UK, and the author of Emily Brontë Reappraised. Three years after the novel was published, Charlotte Brontë revealed the true identity of its author – Ellis Bell was not in fact a man, but a pen name for her younger sister, Emily Brontë. Charlotte argued that critics had failed to do Emily's work justice, ""The immature but very real powers revealed in Wuthering Heights were scarcely recognised; its import and nature were misunderstood."" A gothic tale of two families set on the wild Yorkshire moors, Wuthering Heights went on to become a genre-defining classic – and yet, Charlotte's words still ring true. Now, Saltburn director Emerald Fennell is poised to reveal her version of the story, with a film released on 13 February, starring Australian actors Margot Robbie as Catherine Earnshaw and Jacob Elordi as Heathcliff. Perhaps partly in response to the various controversies preceding her film – around the age and ethnicity of the lead actors, the erotically charged scenes and inauthentic costumes shown in the trailer – Fennell added quotation marks to its title, stating that she is not actually adapting the novel, but making her version of it, because the story is too ""dense, complicated and difficult"". Could she be right? And just why has this ""strange"" but captivating novel puzzled fans, readers and critics from the beginning? Fennell isn't wrong about the book's complex nature. Its non-linear, multi-layered structure and multiple narrators can be mind-boggling at first. Why does everyone have the same name? How many Cathys and Catherines and Lintons and Heathcliffs and Linton Heathcliffs can there possibly be in 300-odd pages? Wuthering Heights is effectively a story-within-a-story. Jumping between the past and present, and spanning around 30 years, it is told by Lockwood, Heathcliff's tenant, and Ellen Dean, a maid at two houses called Thrushcross Grange and Wuthering Heights. Both narrators are unreliable. Lockwood, a gentleman from London with a superiority complex, serves as a nosey outsider and a vessel for the reader to uncover secrets from the past. Nelly, the revealer of said secrets, tells the story from a seemingly perfect memory. She controls the narrative and often interferes when perhaps she shouldn't – her emotional attachments to certain characters, and judgment of others, shine through. Fennell has spoken of how she was captivated by the novel when she first read it as a teenager. Her film uses the tagline ""the greatest love story of all time"", but the greatest revenge story of all time might be more apt. Of course, there is undeniable romantic passion in the story: ""Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same; and Linton's is as different as a moonbeam from lightning, or frost from fire."" But some readers may have latched onto this, while forgetting what ensues afterwards. It quickly becomes clear that Heathcliff is more of a tortured anti-hero than a romantic one. Catherine is challenging too – she is melodramatic and spiteful. Their unbreakable bond, while spirited and everlasting, is ill-fated ­– and their unending misery creates a generational cycle of abuse and destruction begging to be broken. The structure of Wuthering Heights cleverly plays into these themes of passion and revenge. The first edition was divided into two volumes, which could be perceived as the generational divide – the first focusing on Catherine and Heathcliff, the second focusing on their children. Brontë draws on our sympathy for Heathcliff in the first volume. Upon his arrival at the Heights as an orphaned young boy, he is othered, a ""ragged, black-haired child… a dark-skinned gipsy in aspect"". Catherine even spits on him. Later, he is physically abused by his drunkard adoptive brother Hindley Earnshaw, who treats him as a servant. Throughout, he is referred to as ""dirty"". His only solace is Catherine, with whom he roams the wild moors. But even then, despite her declaration, ""I am Heathcliff… he is more myself than I am,"" and partly due to a misheard conversation, she marries the wealthy Edgar Linton of Thrushcross Grange. Heathcliff's revenge on Edgar and Catherine intensifies in the second half of the novel, after the latter's death. Brontë sorely tests any sympathy readers might have had for Heathcliff, as his monstrous tyranny reigns. He physically and psychologically abuses his wife (and Catherine's sister-in-law) Isabella through vile acts like hanging her dog. He also abuses the family's children. Hindley's son Hareton is forced to work as a servant just as Heathcliff was as a young boy. He kidnaps Cathy Linton, Catherine and Edgar's daughter, forcing her to marry his son, Linton Heathcliff, to secure ownership of Thrushcross Grange. Every action is deliberate, calculated and vengeful. Some film and TV adaptations have skipped the second half of Wuthering Heights entirely, presumably because of its savagery and complexity – William Wyler's 1939 Oscar-winner ends shortly after Catherine's death, her ghost and Heathcliff wandering the moors. Robert Fuest's 1970 film starring Timothy Dalton also ends with her death, as does Andrea Arnold's 2011 film, which dedicates most of the screen time to the younger Catherine and Heathcliff. But her death comes halfway through the novel and therefore many adaptations have missed out a further 18 years or so of plot, softening the ending and sanitising its darkest parts. A few have attempted to cover the whole story – including the BBC's 1967 series, which inspired Kate Bush to write her 1978 hit. But it's the BBC's 1978 mini-series (aided by its five-hour running time), which is held up as being the most faithful to the whole text. Ignoring the latter part of the book ""doesn't work"", says Claire O'Callaghan. ""I think love and vengeance are the engines of the book, and that's what so great about it… there's no boundary to the depths to which [Heathcliff] will go to, to make people pay,"" says O'Callaghan. Heathcliff lives a life of torment and uncontainable grief, but inflicts that suffering on everyone around him and feels no remorse in doing so. By not righting his wrongs, and letting him die without further punishment, O'Callaghan says, Brontë poses more complex questions to the reader, rather than giving them answers: What is love? Does the marriage system work? What are the limits of violence? That's part of the complex legacy of the novel. ""Popular culture tends to tell us it's this great romance… when [readers] are encountering it for the first time, that jars, because the book is so different. It still has the ability to shock, and I think, like the Victorians, we're still grappling with how to define it and what to do with it,"" O'Callaghan says. Another popular misconception of the novel is that it's unremittingly bleak, when, at times, it's quite funny. Nelly and Zillah, the two servants, are major gossips. Linton Heathcliff is a mopey, sickly and bratty child, who provokes an eye roll from the reader. And when you can understand what the farm servant Joseph is saying through his thick Yorkshire dialect, he is often a witty cynic, who never has anything nice to say. When Catherine falls ill after searching for Heathcliff in the rain, he snarkily croaks, ""Running after t'lads, as usual?"" More like this: • Why Heathcliff and literature's greatest love story are toxic • Why readers are wrong about Mr Darcy • Why Frankenstein is so misunderstood Lockwood's snootiness is amusing, too. ""He is like a character from a Jane Austen novel who's walked into a Brontë world, and that, for me, is hilarious,"" says O'Callaghan. ""If you read this book and take it as a kind of gothic satire to some extent, it's a completely different book. And I think that's one of the things, though. People take it very, very seriously, don't they? They're absolutely convinced that these are real characters, rather than this gothic, over-the-topness."" Emily Brontë never saw the success of her only novel, but we know that she read initial reviews. Her writing desk is on display at the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, and it contains five clippings of Wuthering Heights reviews, which were largely negative. She died at the age of 30 from tuberculosis, around a year after Wuthering Heights was published. Behind her she leaves a masterpiece. Whether you are a fierce lover or loather of Brontë's deeply flawed characters, the harrowing and unsettling plot and the toxic romance, Wuthering Heights has possessed its legions of fans throughout history – ""driven us mad"", you could say. We can be sure that Fennell's interpretation will not be the last. Whether anyone can do this book justice on screen, however, is a whole other question. Hopefully, at least, we can all agree with one anonymous critic, who reviewed Wuthering Heights in January 1848. ""It is impossible to begin and not finish it,"" they said, ""and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about it."" Wuthering Heights is released on 13 February. -- If you liked this story, sign up for the Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

62,BBC,The story behind cinema's greatest ever final shot,https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20260120-the-story-behind-city-lights-and-cinemas-greatest-ever-final-shot,"Ninety-five years after its release, Charlie Chaplin's silent comedy, City Lights, is often cited as one of the greatest films ever made – and its final moments are key to its reputation. When Charlie Chaplin was asked by Life Magazine in 1966 which of his films he regarded as his favourite, he gave the honour to City Lights, before downplaying his achievements with, ""I think it's solid, well done."" Since its premiere at the Los Angeles Theatre on 30 January 1931, cinephiles and film-makers have heaped slightly more effusive praise on the silent romantic comedy, in which Chaplin's Tramp character falls in love with a blind flower girl (Virginia Cherrill), who mistakes him for a millionaire. When the British Film Institute released the first of its renowned lists of the greatest films of all time in 1952, City Lights came joint second alongside Chaplin's The Gold Rush (1925). Stanley Kubrick, Orson Welles, and Andrei Tarkovksy each named it as one of their favourite films, while The Night of the Hunter screenwriter James Agee wrote that it contained the ""greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies"". The moment in question from comes right at the end of City Lights. Finally reunited with the flower girl, who can now see, the Tramp stares at her lovingly, as the camera fades to black. It's a shot of such pure emotion and simple poignancy that it is regularly cited as the greatest ending in cinematic history. In the 95 years since City Lights' release, numerous films have tried to replicate its subtle artistry and the power of its performances. Years of creative toil and suffering went in to making the final sequence, which only works because the final act of City Lights sets it up so well. After the Tramp learns the flower girl is going to be evicted from her apartment, he works as a street sweeper, then a boxer. Eventually he gets the money from a drunk millionaire who forgets him when he's sober – and accuses the Tramp of stealing from him. Just before the Tramp is arrested, he gives the funds to the flower girl. She is able to pay her rent and see a doctor who can cure her blindness. Months later, when the Tramp is released from prison, he discovers she now has vision and is running her own, very successful flower shop. The tattered Tramp appears outside it. When she finally recognises him, a look of deep affection appears on her face. He smiles back, as the film comes to an end. Charles Marland, who wrote the BFI Classics book celebrating City Lights, believes its final scene is the definitive example of Chaplin's mastery as a film-maker. ""He knew how to frame the shots to intensify the emotional effect of the scene. The camera tightens from a medium to a close-up,"" he tells the BBC, before noting that Chaplin once said he used long shots for comedy, and close-ups for tragedy and drama. ""Then there's the soundtrack, which is complex, emotional, and provokes an intellectual response."" All of this would be for nothing without the performances from Chaplin and Cherrill, who rather remarkably made her film debut with City Lights. After shooting several takes of their final exchange, Chaplin felt they were going overboard, overacting and over-feeling it, says Marland. So Chaplin decided that the Tramp should just look at Cherrill with more intensity. According to Marland, Chaplin once described filming the sequence as ""a beautiful sensation of not acting. Of standing outside of myself. The key was being slightly embarrassed, delighted about meeting her again, apologetic without getting emotional. [The Tramp is] watching and wondering what she is thinking. It was so pure."" Years after City Lights' release, Cherill told Jeffrey Vance, the author of Chaplin: Genius of the Cinema, that Chaplin usually had dry skin, but she felt his palm get moist as they got closer to the required performance. ""She knew something was happening to him that was unusual,"" Vance tells the BBC. ""That she was giving him what he wanted and he was reacting differently. He was reacting as the character."" One vital reason why City Lights has continued to resonate over the decades is Chaplin's decision to cut away before we get a conclusive ending. Romantics will maintain that, despite his shabby look and lack of money, the flower girl accepts the Tramp after what he did for her. But there are others who believe that there's no chance of her going off into the proverbial sunset with him. ""I don't think it's romantic at all,"" says Vance. ""We see her vanity when her sight is restored. She looks in the mirror. Fusses with her hair. She is disappointed the wealthy man is not him. When she first sees the Tramp, she giggles, and gives him money out of pity."" By going from overjoyed, terrified, ashamed, to excited, Chaplin's performance in those final moments is so layered and subtle that it leaves it to viewers to decide what happens next. There are, of course, many rival claimants to the title of the greatest final shot in cinema history. Planet of the Apes' Statue of Liberty sighting, the slow realisation in The Graduate, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid's freeze-frame finish, the door closing in The Godfather, and Norma Desmond asking for her close-up in Sunset Boulevard each deserve a mention. But none of these has been replicated quite as often as City Lights' final moment. Films as diverse as The 400 Blows, This Is England, Gone Girl, and Moonlight owe Chaplin a debt, as they each end with characters staring down the camera. Several films have been much more overt with their homages. Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979) ends with his character ruefully smiling at his young girlfriend Tracy, after she confirms she's going to London for six months. A year later, in The Long Good Friday, director John Mackenzie focused on Bob Hoskins' gangster going through a variety of emotions in quick succession as he realises he's been caught by IRA assassins and is going to be killed. Even the end of Pixar's Monsters, Inc. tips its animated hat to City Lights. Rather than showing Sulley's reunion with Boo, after the pair were seemingly separated forever when the portal into her bedroom was destroyed, we just see him opening her door, looking around, hearing Boo say, ""Kitty!"" and smiling. As is so often the case, brevity makes these moments even more powerful. But it still takes hours of creativity, skill, and talent – as well as thousands, sometimes millions, of dollars – to put these scenes on celluloid. That was especially true of City Lights. Not only was it Chaplin's most expensive film – with production costs of $1.5m (around $30m or £22m today) – but he spent years crafting the story, shooting it, and hoping it would live up to immense expectations that met his work. When cameras started rolling on City Lights on 27 December 1928, Chaplin was the most famous man in the world. He'd risen from London squalor to become a multimillionaire who had complete creative control over his films. So much so that, even though The Jazz Singer had become the first talking picture 14 months earlier, and Hollywood was no longer interested in silent films, Chaplin insisted that City Lights would have no lines of dialogue. He was very adamant that the Tramp was a creature of the silent film,"" says Vance. ""But he also knew he needed to make a perfect film. He felt that was the only way an audience was going to accept a silent film."" Chaplin was so concerned with making City Lights as flawless as possible that he spent a year in pre-production and filming lasted all the way through until September 1930. More like this: • The story behind Hollywood's most famous side-eye • The most exciting films coming up in 2026 • The inside story of the wildest film shoot ever The Tramp's first meeting with the flower girl, where she mistakes him for a millionaire, plagued Chaplin to such an extent that it still holds the Guinness World Record for the most retakes for a single scene. He eventually shot the sequence 342 times. Chaplin's creative toil was worth it. City Lights went on to make three times its budget at the box office and was met with rave reviews, while its reputation has only improved with time. In the decades since, despite Modern Times' biting satire, The Great Dictator's rousing ending, and The Gold Rush's iconic comedic set pieces, City Lights has proven to be Chaplin's most enduring and endearing film. ""Like Dickens novels and Shakespeare plays, Chaplin films go in and out of fashion,"" says Vance. ""But City Lights' beauty is in its simplicity. Chaplin knew simplicity was very difficult to achieve."" The power and poetry of City Lights is best summed up by its final image of a hopeful Tramp smiling and dreaming of a brighter future, which – nearly 100 years and tens of thousands of ""talkies"" later – no other ending has yet come close to matching. ""That's why Chaplin was a genius,"" says Vance. ""That's why he was in a class by himself."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

63,BBC,Inside Italy's forgotten art town,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260113-italys-strangest-art-town-is-getting-a-second-chance,"Once dismissed as a failed postmodern utopia, the Sicilian town of Gibellina is preparing for a year-long programme of exhibitions, performances and artist residencies. But can art finally bring life back to a place conceived as an art utopia? The theatre straddles the road, a hump-backed concrete leviathan dominating the skyline. Designed by Italian sculptor Pietro Consagra, Teatro is one of the most iconic buildings in Gibellina – but it looks more like an abandoned multistorey car park than a theatre. Built in the first half of the 1980s, it remains unfinished some 40 years later. I've never seen any building like it. Teatro is one of hundreds of neglected artworks and postmodern buildings scattered through the town, which was rebuilt in the 1970s and reimagined as an art utopia, with sculptures and architectural designs on every corner. Yet, this open-air museum receives few visitors; not many holidaymakers think to take a day trip from Palermo or the white-sand beach of San Vito Lo Capo. In 2026, however, that is expected to change. Italy has named Gibellina its first-ever Capital of Contemporary Art, launching a year-long programme of exhibitions, performances and artist residencies designed to transform the town's long-dormant buildings and public spaces. For travellers, it offers a rare chance to experience a place mid-transformation – part open-air museum, part working cultural experiment – at a moment when the town is launching an urban revival. Teatro was being prepared to reopen as an exhibition space when I visited in November, with workers building steps to the upper floors and barriers in front of the windows, which otherwise offered only a vertiginous drop onto the road below. I noticed graffiti flowering up the walls and pools of rainwater collecting at the bottom of ramps. Andrea Cusumano, the director of the year's programme, showed me around. An artistic polymath who has conducted orchestras, published poetry, directed plays and created art installations around Europe, he swept through the space in a long black coat, switching easily between English and Italian. ""Right now, this is just a sculpture – we want to turn it into a building,"" he told me, explaining that Teatro would keep its industrial grittiness but be made safe for visitors. The inaugural show in the space will be video installations by the Italian artistic duo Masbedo and the Albanian artist Adrian Paci. It's part of a wider programme in which artists are encouraged to include the town and its abandoned buildings in their art. In May, for example, the artists Francesco Lauretta and Luigi Presicce will combine open-to-all drawing classes in public spaces with performances at symbolic architectural sites around the town. Plan your trip: How to get there: Gibellina is 90km (56 miles) south-west of Palermo; a direct bus from the Palermo airport takes about an hour. When to go: Events begin in January 2026, with the programme intensifying as the weather warms. June onwards will see outdoor concerts and performances in Gibellina's public squares. What else to see: Outside Gibellina, visit the Cretto di Burri, an immense artwork by Italian artist Alberto Burri. He compacted the ruins of Old Gibellina under white cement, forever fixing them in time. The site will also be the stage for the recreation of an iconic theatre production of the Greek tragedy The Oresteia, translated into Sicilian dialect, at the end of June. Where to stay: There are no hotels in Gibellina itself, but locals rent out Airbnbs. You can also stay in the nearby towns of Salemi or Castelvetrano, or head to one of the fishing towns along the coast to squeeze in some beach days. Palermo can also work as a base for longer day trips. The ambitious programme marks what could be described as a third renaissance for the town. Old Gibellina was destroyed after an earthquake ripped through western Sicily's Belice Valley on 14 January 1968, killing around 400 people and rendering almost 100,000 in the surrounding area homeless. The Italian government declared a national emergency and vowed to rebuild, selecting a new site 10km (6 miles) away between a planned motorway and a railway line. But relief and reconstruction were agonisingly slow, mired in corruption, bureaucracy and general indecision. Different plans were drawn up and discarded, even after building work had already begun. Thousands of people ended up living in temporary camps for more than a decade. The result bore little resemblance to the bucolic farming village that had stood before. Engineers and urban planners imported ideas from the ""New Town"" movement, replacing the winding streets with wide, car-friendly avenues and swapping the tightly packed houses tumbling down the hillside for carbon-copy villas with individual parking spaces. ""The huge mistake made by the state was to copy urban models found in northern Europe, which were designed to respond to the needs of rapidly growing industrialised cities. But Sicily never had an industrial revolution,"" said Alessandra Badami, an architecture professor at the University of Palermo. ""Suddenly residents found themselves in an urban landscape that was like nothing they had ever seen before."" With limited job opportunities in the new town, the population began to drift away. That's when the charismatic mayor Ludovico Corrao made the radical decision in the 1970s to inject art into Gibellina, inviting well-known artists and architects to transform the town with public artworks. Gibellina has since been likened to the Texan art hub of Marfa for its density of contemporary works and postmodern architecture. The result is a strange utopian landscape that's neither American suburbia nor rural Italy. Gibellina is small; visitors don't need more than a couple of days. There are a handful of restaurants and bars, along with some small but dynamic art-focused museums. But the real appeal is its sheer concentration of artworks. Turn almost any corner and you'll encounter an unusual building, arresting sculpture or a two-storey photograph pasted on an apartment block. When I wandered through its streets on a brisk evening, the town felt like a relic from another era, the Brutalist concrete skeletons of buildings seeming at once outmoded and futuristic. One of the most astonishing works is the Chiesa Madre, a design for the town church, which took 25 years to complete. I first saw it at night when its glass doors formed a rhombus of greenish light at the top of a long flight of steps. Around the back, a vast concrete sphere hung like an enormous Christmas ornament, glowing white against the dark backdrop of the town. It felt ghostly; an alien structure dropped in the Sicilian interior. Alongside its role as the local church, it will host a photography exhibition by the photographer Francesco Bellina in September. Much of Gibellina feels like an urban wilderness. Locals told me that few residents use the Sistema delle Piazze, a sequence of stark rectangular plazas designed by architects Franco Purini and Laura Thermes to serve as the town's communal heart. When I visited, empty beer bottles littered a stairwell behind a padlocked gate leading up to the piazza's balcony and stray dogs drank from puddles in the empty fountains. Badami says Gibellina's public spaces may be architecturally brilliant, but it is precisely that lofty architectural language that repels residents. ""Purini and Thermes' piazza is fantastic, like stepping into a De Chirico painting. But a city is not a painting. Squares need activity. You go to a square because there are benches, a newsstand, shade, a place for children to play."" Organisers hope that art and participatory events can draw residents back, and the Sistema delle Piazze is one of the public areas that will be cleaned up to host walks and free events. From July, visitors can also visit a public installation by the Kosovar artist Sislej Xhafa, whose conceptual sculptures will also aim to ""repopulate"" the square. Cusumano is pragmatic about what the town's new art designation can achieve. ""My aim is not to transform Gibellina into a town for tourists who love contemporary art, but to create a community for artists,"" he said. ""That seems more probable than luring back residents who have left. We want to make something sustainable enough to keep going long after the year has ended."" More like this: • Inside Italy's secret mosaic school • Huge Roman 'jigsaw' reveals 2,000-year-old wall paintings • Bussana Vecchia: The battle over Italy's eclectic, handbuilt village Not everyone is convinced. Local artist Nicolò Stabile was just one year old when the earthquake hit and spent his childhood living in temporary housing, growing up in parallel with the town's construction. Fiercely attached to Gibellina, he thinks the local authorities are incapable of managing and preserving the town's artistic heritage. ""They don't speak the language of contemporary art and have been unable – or unwilling – to continue what Corrao started,"" he said, leading me into the Palazzo di Lorenzo, a building designed by Italian architect Francesco Venezia that preserves the facade of a building from Old Gibellina at its centre, and which has fallen into disuse. We walked through its looping interior as a violet-pink sunset bloomed across the sky and pulled chicken wire to one side to pass through a doorway, startling pigeons who spooked above our heads. On the lower floor, Stabile flicked on the lights to illuminate a frozen-in-time installation from a 2019 photography exhibition by Moira Ricci, complete with curatorial texts. It was another example of how easily art here slips back into neglect. ""As soon as the year is over, all the buildings will close again. I'm sure of it,"" Stabile said. Whether that prediction proves true remains to be seen. In the meantime, artists are arriving, scaffolding is going up and long-abandoned spaces are being prepared for use. Gibellina may never resolve the contradictions it was built upon, but in 2026 it will once again be animated by the very thing that defined its beginnings: art. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

66,BBC,Eight of New Orleans' best live music venues,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20240207-an-insiders-guide-to-the-best-live-music-venues-in-new-orleans,"Singer-songwriter Andrew Duhon shares the best live music in his hometown New Orleans, from acoustic sets at The Tigermen Den to candlelit piano acts at Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar. New Orleans, with its famous ""Big Easy"" vibe, fabulous food and exhilarating live music scene, might just be America's biggest party – and not just during its iconic Mardi Gras celebration. Its eclectic neighbourhoods straddling the snaking Mississippi River are home to a year-round bevy of musical acts, spanning styles from funk to blues to the New Orleans-bred genres of jazz, Cajun-infused zydeco and hip-hop subset Bounce. The SpeciaList Singer-songwriter Andrew Duhon was raised in the Metairie suburb of New Orleans, started doing open mics in the big city when he was in his early teens and now tours the nation to perform his troubadour-style folk and blues. His 5th studio album was released in 2025. We asked Andrew Duhon, a NOLA-based singer-songwriter, to help us find his hometown's best live music venues. ""This isn't just any other city that we're living in,"" said Duhon. ""This is a special place to wander around, and the stories are everywhere, through every aged wooden French-style door that opens up into a beautiful courtyard in the French Quarter."" But with so many stories – and venues – to choose from, Duhon, who performs all over the country with his folk and blues trio, gravitates towards places that ""feel"" like New Orleans. ""To stand on the corner at a place like BJ's in the Bywater and talk to the local folk,"" he said. ""Half of them you might recognise and be familiar with and the other half, you're going to be friends in five minutes and enjoy a show inside."" Duhon remains especially influenced by the city itself, which he believes unconsciously inspires every NOLA-based creative and lives in its best music venues. ""I can come home and feel that sense of history in a room like that and a welcoming back. I think that is truly unique to New Orleans."" Here are eight of Andrew Duhon's favourite spots to catch live music acts in New Orleans. 1. Best large venue that stages national acts: Tipitina's ""The first place that comes to mind is Tipitina's,"" said Duhon, citing the rustic juke joint that has been one of New Orleans' most revered music venues since it opened in 1977. ""It was named after a song by [iconic New Orleans pianist] Professor Longhair. So even the name is of New Orleans."" Tipitina's is found in Uptown New Orleans and hosts an immense variety of excellent NOLA acts like bounce artist Big Freedia and a jam-packed calendar of Mardi Gras programming. ""They will have nationally touring acts come through,"" said Duhon. ""They're a big enough room to have that sort of thing happen. But there's also plenty local stuff going on there. And it feels like New Orleans at Tipitina's, you know, it's not a sterile room. It's very special inside and the music that they have is special, too."" Website: https://tipitinas.com/ Address: 501 Napoleon Ave, New Orleans, LA 70115 Phone: (504) 895-8477 Instagram: @tipitinas 2. Best for making a night of it: the Maple Leaf Bar For visitors planning a whole evening in New Orleans, Duhon recommends the funky watering hole the Maple Leaf Bar, also Uptown, which has hosted live acts since 1974. Tip When you're in town, tune into WWOZ New Orleans 90.7 FM. ""Let's say I’m coming home off the road, and I want to go see a show,” said Duhon. “They’re community operated. Every DJ is a volunteer. They all love it. And they all have that same energy of just having their finger on the pulse of what's happening in New Orleans."" Duhon also recommends the Louisiana Music Factory record shop on Frenchmen Street. ""Another perfect resource if you wanted to pick yourself up some New Orleans records,"" he said. ""Or even just pop in and get to talking about what's going on locally. Those guys would love to chat about it."" ""It's a little smaller, less nationally touring acts getting through there,"" said Duhon of the music club, housed in a bi-level 19th-Century frame town home. ""But it was home to many of the forefathers of New Orleans music [who] used to play there, and it remains a great venue."" The Maple Leaf Bar's acts offer hot sets in genres including funk, blues, zydeco, R&B and jazz, and while the bar is most known for providing a platform for up-and-coming local artists, it also welcomes the occasional, surprise drop-in sesh by household name musicians, like legendary rocker Bruce Springsteen and NOLA native jazz musician Jon Batiste. ""It's also next door to an excellent restaurant for New Orleans food which is called Jacque-Imo's,"" said Duhon. ""So, you can make a perfect little night of it. You book yourself table at Jacque-Imo's, get yourself something to eat, and then go see a funk band next door. I mean, what's not to love?"" Duhon recommends the alligator cheesecake: ""Seems like a must."" Website: https://www.mapleleafbar.com/ Address: 8316 Oak Street, New Orleans, LA 70118 Phone: (504) 866-9359 Instagram: @mapleleafnola 3. Best listening room: Chickie Wah Wah For the discerning music lover who wants nothing more than to sit down and listen in a chill space with a cocktail in their hand, Duhon recommends heading to Chickie Wah Wah, an unassuming white brick cottage on the Canal Street streetcar line offering a constant line up of great musical acts. ""The owner passed away a few years back and there was word that it might go away,"" said Duhon. ""But since then, I'm glad to report that new owners – all of them just understanding and loving New Orleans – are doing good things with that room. And I think it's a great spot to catch a show."" Chickie Wah Wah's intimate space is a magnet for a New Orleans-style blend of musical styles. ""They'll do the singer-songwriter type things, you know, broad in that sense,"" said Duhon, who enjoys performing at Chickie Wah Wah when he's in town. ""It can be anything from country to rock and roll to local Cajun music, but, you know, something that you can sit and listen to."" Website: https://chickiewahwah.com Address: 2828 Canal Street, New Orleans, LA 70119 Phone: (504) 541-2050 Instagram: @chickiewahwahnola  4. Best dive bar with eclectic line up: Le Bon Temps Roule If a dive bar immediately conjures up images of a barely functioning jukebox, allow your horizons to be broadened with a visit to Le Bon Temps Roule – or Le Bon Temps, as it's affectionately called by locals. Celebrating Mardi Gras Mardi Gras is a thrilling time to visit New Orleans - held this year on 17 February. ""It’s its own kind of revelry, with many ways to go about it,"" said Duhon. ""Until Fat Tuesday there'll be parades every weekend, which can be enjoyed from the sidewalk side or the neutral ground side or up on a ladder with children."" Aside from Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar, Duhon also recommends The R Bar and Anna's as ""excellent Mardi Gras hangs"". But he warns: ""To be clear, the bars themselves are a fine place to get a drink, but the hang is happening on the street – and showing up to one of these spots without a costume might leave you feeling underdressed."" ""It's a dive bar with a live music room in the back,"" explained Duhon. ""It's dark and woody and yeah, it feels like New Orleans in there."" Le Bon Temps Roule is nestled on a corner of Magazine Street, housed in a historic late 19th-Century building painted an eye-catching red. Visitors can relax with a game of billiards as they take in the vast array of acts, from soul to hip hop DJ sets, or enjoy a hearty pub menu of burgers and sandwiches, washed down with a Bloody Mary, the house cocktail. ""It's a great room,"" said Duhon. ""Not too big. It's a dive venue and lovely. They'll do brass bands in the back; everything from country to brass."" Website: https://lbtrnola.com/ Address: 4801 Magazine Street, New Orleans LA 70115 Phone: (504) 897-3448 Instagram: @lebontempsroulenola 5. Best for wandering from venue to venue with a drink in your hand: Frenchmen Street and Saint Claude Avenue If certain venues ""feel"" like New Orleans, there are two streets – or corridors, in NOLA-speak – that encapsulate the vibe for Duhon. ""Maybe you just picked up a cocktail from one room, but you want to go to the next,"" he said. ""You can bring that cocktail along to the next room if you like. You can walk with your drink in New Orleans."" Duhon's favourite music venue-lined corridors are Frenchmen Street and Saint Claude Avenue. ""When I was a kid figuring out my songwriter thing, Frenchmen Street felt pure,"" Duhon reminisced. ""It felt like the tourists hadn't found [it] yet."" Duhon concedes that gentrification is sneaking into the corridor, but the stalwarts remain. ""The ones that come to mind are DBA, Snug Harbor [Jazz Bistro] and The Spotted Cat Music Club,"" he said. ""DBA can be a mixed bag; everything from rock to jazz. Snug Harbor is strictly jazz. [There's a] seated area around a small stage, very intimate, quiet, a place where you can really tuck in and listen… and across the street, the Spotted Cat is a whole different take on jazz. That's a small room where there aren't seats; you're just shoulder to shoulder with the locals and a beer in your hand and on the stage is probably somebody crooning some jazz tunes, Dixieland."" On Saint Claude Avenue, Duhon likes [indie music room] Hi-Ho Lounge; metal, punk and underground band venue Siberia; Allways Lounge [cabaret]; alternative music spot Saturn Bar and Sweet Lorraine's [jazz club]. ""I think either Frenchmen or Saint Claude are great options,"" said Duhon. ""I wouldn't even have to look at a calendar… I could go to either one of those corridors and feel like I'm going to find something cool… A walk-in beverage, a couple of friends, or not. Make a couple of friends! That's New Orleans, you know?"" 6. The best of Bourbon Street (from a local's POV): Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar When discussing Bourbon Street – the most iconic stretch in New Orleans' gorgeous yet heavily-touristed French Quarter – Duhon quickly supplied: ""Locals don't go to Bourbon Street."" However, he does like Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop Bar – a piano bar housed in an early 18th-Century slate-roofed blacksmith's shop believed to be the first building to be used as a bar in the United States. ""You start on Canal Street, and you walk down Bourbon and it's a party, it's a party, it's a party,"" said Duhon. ""About three blocks after that party starts to recede, there's one bar left, just about three or four blocks. They do have a candlelit piano in the back so occasionally you will find music in there. But it is a place where locals will go to have a drink. It's a great place for Mardi Gras day to convene."" Lafitte's Blacksmith Shop – believed to have been used as a pirates' and smugglers' den in the 1700s – has survived several fires and is widely believed to be haunted. ""But that's a special spot,"" said Duhon. ""It existed long before electricity so it kind of feels like they're trying to keep that up. It's very dark in there with candles and whatnot.""

Best place to feel the ghosts of New Orleans jazz history: Preservation Hall To continue communing with New Orleans spirits, head a little further afield of Bourbon Street and find Preservation Hall in the French Quarter – Duhon's pick for a place where you can feel the ghosts of NOLA musicians past. ""Haunted would be the wrong word,"" said Duhon. ""I would say [it's] probably the place where you can most feel that history… it's the one place I would say near Bourbon Street that is unadulterated by the tourism. [It's] the home of New Orleans jazz."" Preservation Hall has hosted nightly jazz shows since 1961, and is home to the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. ""All of the guys in that band, the Pres Hall Band, their life's work is New Orleans jazz,"" said Duhon. ""And Preservation Hall is where it's preserved, as the name suggests, but if you're looking for a best place to feel the history, that's the spot. And they have, like, three shows a night. It's very good."" Website: https://www.preservationhall.com/ Address: 726 Saint Peter Street, New Orleans, LA 70116 Phone: (504) 522-2841 Instagram: @preservationhall 8. Best new(ish) venue: The Tigermen Den Duhon loves his tried-and-true NOLA's iconic music venues, but every now and then, he makes a discovery in his own hometown. ""Just a couple of weeks ago, I went to see a group of songwriters each take a set at a place called The Tigermen Den,"" said Duhon. ""A corner building that I didn't know was a venue, but [I walked] through the gate and into this beautiful little patio where the owner of the building was serving cocktails."" The Tigermen Den in the Bywater, housed in a former Creole dry goods store dating back to 1830, has been used as a music venue since 2011 and now also functions as a community cultural centre. But Duhon believes the musical ghosts of New Orleans are busily at play. ""Inside it was like walking into a building from 100 years ago,"" he said. ""And we all just sat in a room and listened to people with guitars sing their songs, one after the other. And it was beautiful."" Duhon paused to add: ""It felt like New Orleans.""

67,BBC,A surprising solution for the summer childcare crunch,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260203-how-hotels-could-help-solve-your-summer-childcare-crunch,"As summer school breaks stretch longer and childcare becomes harder to secure, some families are turning to an unexpected solution: hotels offering full-day, structured kids' camps that allow parents to travel, work and keep routines intact. Life is never quiet when you're a parent of young children but plotting how to cover the long spring and summer breaks when schools shut down and work carries on can be particularly challenging. Camps fill up fast, babysitters can be hard to secure and relatives rarely have infinite time or patience. Traditionally, most families look close to home for childcare. But in a world of remote work, flexible schedules and Zoom meetings, some parents are starting to look further afield. A growing number of hotels now offer full-day structured and educational kids' clubs that allow parents to travel – and keep working – while their children are occupied elsewhere. This is not a mass-market solution; these programmes are largely aimed at families with flexible jobs and the budget to pay for premium accommodation and childcare. But for those who can access it, hotel-based camps are reshaping how some parents think about summer logistics, turning what is usually a juggling act into an opportunity to travel. Take Camp Manitou, for example, which partners with several Four Seasons hotels in Hawaii and select Auberge properties in New Mexico and California. Its Adventure Camp Days (for ages eight to 17; $225 [£164.25] per person all-inclusive) typically kick off in Hawaii with stand-up paddling or snorkelling from 07:30, followed by breakfast and a packed schedule of surfing, swimming, beach games and pizza making before a 15:30 pick up. ""[The camps are] run by real youth-programming pros,"" says Kristin Winkaffe, founder of travel advisory service Winkaffe Global Travel. ""The consistency is the big win. If parents need to work, Four Seasons tends to be a safe choice because the wi-fi actually works and the kids' clubs run on a schedule you can count on."" Practical options for working parents on the road Ritz Kids: The Ritz-Carlton runs full-day Ritz Kids programmes at many of its properties across the globe, with a focus on destination-specific activities, education and conservation. In southern California's Laguna Niguel, that means bird box painting and squid dissections; while up the coast in Santa Barbara, it's more about tide pooling and learning about Chumash history. Boundless Camps: Boundless Life offers four-week getaways that bundle accommodation, coworking spaces and an educational programme for children from 08:45 to 15:15 on weekdays. Kids follow a structured curriculum incorporating mindfulness, academic sessions and immersion in nature and culture. Destinations include Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Portugal. Hyatt Hotels: Hyatt runs well-priced full-day camps for kids up to 12. In Aruba, Camp Watapana includes scavenger hunts, wildlife tours and a beginners' lesson in Papiamento (the local Creole dialect) for $95 (£69.36) per day. Kids for All Seasons: The upscale Four Seasons hotel group runs its full-day Kids for All Seasons programme at many of its properties. Erin Green of Pique Travel singles out Four Seasons Punta Mita in Mexico for its all-day kids' club, game room, babysitting service and kid-focussed amenities. Winkaffe says many of her clients use these elevated childcare programmes to blend holidays with remote work. ""It's usually parents in consulting, law, tech or any job where going totally offline just isn't realistic,"" she says. As a mother herself, Winkaffe says that mixing both modes is ""pretty much the only way we get to travel as often as we do"". She explains: ""We'll set up in our suite, block off a few hours work while our daughter is enjoying herself and then go do something fun together."" Winkaffe says the appeal is emotional as much as logistical. ""We still get family time, we can all explore and share experiences together and no one feels 'mom or dad guilt'."" Options vary widely by age, destination and intensity. In Scotland, Gleneagles hotel runs the Glen Adventurers Programme for kids aged three to 12 during school holidays, from 09:30 to 15:15. Younger children can try den building and pottery while older ones tackle archery, tree climbing and woodland skills, earning badges as they progress. In Mexico, travel advisor Erin Green of Pique Travel recommends the all-inclusive Grand Velas resorts. ""At their property in Riviera Maya, the hours go until almost 23:00 so adults can enjoy dinner while taking advantage of the childcare,"" she says. ""They make an effort to incorporate Mexican tradition and culture into their programmes as well."" Winkaffe's personal ""gold standard"" is the Jean-Michel Cousteau Resort in Fiji. ""If I had to pick one resort in the world that actually gets what parents need, it's this: dedicated nannies for little ones; 'buddies' for older kids; and genuinely structured programming all day long."" Activities range from marine-biology lessons and snorkelling excursions to kayaking and introductions to Fijian culture. ""The kids basically disappear into their own world from breakfast to bedtime. Parents can work, nap, dive – whatever. It's the most 'actual summer camp' resort out there,"" she says. Lal Askar, managing director for the Luxury Childcare Association, a new membership organisation for family-friendly hotels and resorts, makes the point that any hotel-based childcare needs to meets or surpass what families rely on at home. He highlights Columbia Beach Resort in Cyprus for its full-day creche and kids' club, plus conference rooms, business centre and office-like suites; as well as Helea Lifestyle Beach Resort in Rhodes. More like this: • The last von Trapp child is 86 - and is still running their US lodge • Austria's 300-year-old luxury hotel powered by trees • A solution for working parents who want to travel ""These destinations each provide high-quality childcare from as early as four months, along with dependable babysitting services, safe environments and highly trained staff,"" he says. ""This combination allows parents to work with confidence while keeping the family's daily rhythm intact."" Another option is to enrol your child in a residential summer camp and work remotely nearby. That's exactly what Jessica Frankovich from Naperville, Illinois, has done for the past two summers. She sent her daughter, Reagan, to Teton Valley Ranch Camp (TVRC) in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, continuing her role for an insurance company from a nearby rental home. At TVRC, kids aged 11 to 16 spend a month at a time immersed in the outdoors, hiking, horseback riding, building fires and exploring nature. Devices and screens are not allowed, but camp-goers send a letter home at least once a week. Frankovich chose to stay close enough so she could be near her daughter and attend the weekly rodeos. ""It was more for our peace of mind,"" she says. She would start work at 06:00 and clock off by 15:30, spending her afternoons hiking or biking. ""To be able to take a few weeks, where this is my life… is great,"" she says. ""It's so refreshing."" Travel advisor Cari Gray of Gray & Co, meanwhile, points to sports camps – such as Rafael Nadal's residential tennis camp in Mallorca and the Juventus Training Sessions in Italy, as well as Schloss Elmau in Germany, which offers full-day care along with soccer camps and ""edu-tainment workshops"". These experiences can be costly, but for families with the means and flexibility, distance is no longer the limiting factor. Frankovich is already planning next summer's adventure after two seasons of remote work. ""I absolutely loved it,"" she says. ""I started calling it mommy summer camp."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

68,BBC,Inside Switzerland's extraordinary medieval library,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260202-inside-switzerlands-extraordinary-medieval-library,"The Abbey Library of St Gallen is a Baroque hall of globes, manuscripts and curiosities that has survived, improbably, for 1,300 years. The church bells were silent and much of the city was still asleep when I arrived at the doors of the abbey in St Gallen. The setting was as expected: a grand sermon in stone, with stark spires and arched windows, marbled cloisters, courtyards and broad steps beckoning visitors inside. Architecture has long been used to inspire faith – but this felt less like discovery than revelation. Waiting inside was Albert Holenstein, a bespectacled historian in his 40s. He ushered me along an echoing corridor to an ornate Baroque doorway, beyond which lay a dimly lit room, its curtains pulled tight across rows of windows. Above the entrance, carved into a large Rococo pediment, was a Greek inscription in bold lettering. ""Psyches Iatreion,"" it read. ""Healing place of the soul,"" he whispered. It was a phrase, I later learnt, associated with the ancient library and scriptorium of King Ramses II in Thebes, Egypt. It sounded like the beginning of a tantalising mystery. Imagine the world's most fantastical library. What would it look like? You might envisage a grand hall lined with antique reading desks and floor-to-ceiling bookcases. Or maybe an elaborate collection that carries the dream-like atmosphere of a fantasy novel. Perhaps, one like Bodley's Library in Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials, itself inspired by the great Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. Or one more like the transcendent, wizardly library of Hogwarts from J K Rowling's Harry Potter saga (indeed, Duke Humfrey's Library, the oldest reading room at the Bodleian Library, served as the production location for the library in the Potter films). The Abbey Library of St Gallen in eastern Switzerland befits the awe and wonder of many of these descriptions. With intricate woodwork, balconied gantries and vast stockpiles of leather-bound tomes, it is one of the world's best-preserved Baroque libraries. And for centuries, Switzerland's largest and oldest monastery library has been regarded as one of Europe's intellectual treasures. Holenstein and I entered and immediately stood beneath an elaborate ceiling fresco surrounded by terrestrial and celestial globes, Egyptian mummies and cabinets of curiosities, each filled with ornamental treasures from far and wide: silver knives in leather sheaths from Turkey; miniature shoes from Indonesia; fossils, shells and coins from all four points of the compass. Our visit began in the 21st Century, but within moments we'd been whisked back to the Middle Ages. ""Incredible, isn't it?"" said Holenstein, director of the Centre of Ecclesiastical Cultural Heritage at the Abbey Library of St Gallen. ""You can't help but marvel at the collection."" Scanning the shelves, I noted works of the fathers of the church, liturgical books and saints' biographies, but also texts about law, music, medicine, astronomy, grammar, arithmetic, rhetoric and secular poetry. ""It is an abundant source of knowledge,"" Holenstein continued. ""The monastery was not only a religious place, but also an educational institution and repository of knowledge, which helps explain the depth of our collection."" Apart from its vast tomes, what makes the library so compelling is its age. Its origins date to the early 7th Century, when the Irish missionary Saint Gall founded a hermitage on this site, later giving rise to the abbey. Although the original library was replaced in 1767 by the present Baroque hall, the continuity is remarkable. Today, the library and its two vast underground depositories contain one of the world's most valuable bodies of written heritage, including 160,000 manuscripts and early printed works, including more than 2,100 medieval codices – some 400 of them written before the year 1000. Among these are the largest assemblage of Irish manuscripts in mainland Europe, brought to St Gallen in the early Middle Ages when Irish pilgrims visited on their way to Rome, leaving gifts at St Gall's tomb. Equally rich for academics is the archive of old High German manuscripts, containing the earliest examples of the language preserved in writing. Every book has its own story, and together they express the spiritual and sublime power of the written word. The other most impressive thing about the library, according to Holenstein, is how the Abbey Library of St Gallen managed to survive centuries of religious and political upheaval. In England, Wales and Ireland in the mid-16th Century, Henry VIII dismantled more than 800 monasteries to seize their wealth, with library collections confiscated and redistributed. During the French Revolution and German mediatisation at the turn of the 18th century, church property was again seized and nationalised. But thanks to the foresight of St Gallen's librarians, the holdings survived the Protestant Reformation unscathed. Even between 1797 and 1805, when the abbey itself was dissolved, its holdings were fiercely guarded, transferred and rescued by the Catholic denomination within the newly founded Canton of St Gallen. ""You could say St Gallen has had a lot of luck,"" said Holenstein. ""Many of our original manuscripts are still in the place where they have been written, studied and conserved for thousands of years."" If you have a taste for the Baroque, then know that the Abbey Library of St Gallen is no one-off in Central Europe. Switzerland's other grand library can be found at Einsiedeln within a 10th-Century Benedictine monastery; while the Melk Abbey Library, which overlooks the River Danube west of Vienna, is another extraordinary temple of literature. More like this: • Gladstone's: The UK's only residential library • Emmentaler: Switzerland's king of cheeses • A library that brings books by sailboat Equally daunting in Austria, Kremsmünster Abbey Library near Salzburg was built between 1680 and 1689, nearly a century before St Gallen's. However, the official title of the world's largest monastic library goes to Styria's Admont Abbey's Baroque storehouse of more than 70,000 volumes. It's hard not to be gripped by the majesty of it all. But St Gallen's library is only one part of the abbey's legacy. The pedestrianised Old Town is built up around the former monastery, and feels like a living museum of quadrangles, religious cloisters, cobblestoned streets and Erststockbeizen, first-floor taverns first popularised by the monks and the pilgrims who followed. Built between five and six centuries ago, so well-worn they have tilting floors and ceilings and warped gothic timber beams, these restaurants are secret sanctuaries in their own right. One of these, Michelin-star rated Zum Goldenen Schäfli, is hidden inside a former butchers' guildhall. Other highlights in keeping with the medieval times include Wirtschaft zur alten Post, Weinstube zum Bäumli and Genussmanufaktur Neubad. Beyond the town centre, the Drei Weieren lakes, created by the monastery in the 17th Century to meet their growing water needs, now serve a wild swimming sanctuaries with Art Nouveau bathhouses on a high plateau above the city. Today, around 190,000 people visit the abbey library each year, far outnumbering the dwindling community of religious pilgrims. Tourism has become essential to maintaining the site – a shift reflected in the library's gift shop, which now sells everything from locally branded cheese fondue to bird seed and slow-brewed beer. Does that threaten the library's spirit? Holenstein is pragmatic. ""The meeting of the spiritual and secular life brings out a conflict in an active monastery,"" he said. ""By their very nature, monasteries and abbeys are restrictive places. But many are struggling and tourism is one of the solutions in helping keep these cultural institutions alive."" Even so, there is a natural restriction for visitors to the abbey, and it is an unusual one. At the library's ornate Baroque doorway are rows of felt pilgrim slippers, which must be worn to protect the varnished wooden floor. To limit numbers and help with conservation, there will only ever be 100 pairs. In an age that prizes digital media, St Gallen's Abbey Library is a reminder that however disconnected you might feel from AI, e-books, online archives, virtual assistants and personalised recommendations, you can still step into a world of knowledge in the middle of an ancient abbey. How extraordinary that the words and memories of the voices from the past continue to speak to us, in our present, in the 21st Century. This sanctuary for the soul is indeed a heavenly place. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

69,BBC,Mountain biking on the top of the world in Nepal,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260130-mountain-biking-the-himalayas-in-everests-shadow,"A new adrenaline-fuelled experience is allowing travellers to see the Himalayas in a new way – and helping local Sherpa residents in the process. Hurtling downhill on a mountain bike in the Himalayas, I was exhilarated, slightly out of breath and secretly worried that a dzo – a yak-cow crossbreed – was going to amble out of the trees into my path, horns first. ""Keep your eyes up, trust your brakes and let the trail guide you,"" said Mingmar Yangzi Sherpa, pedalling ahead of me on a winding dirt path in Nepal's mountainous Solukhumbu District. We paused where the path levelled out atop a grassy hill, offering a view of endless peaks in the distance. ""Mountain biking here lets travellers explore beyond trekking routes, see local life up close and feel true adventure,"" she said. ""It's perfect for anyone who wants more than sightseeing, who wants to feel the land, the culture, the experience of a homestay and the freedom of a ride at altitudes up to 4,060m."" Nepal is far better known for its mountains than its mountain biking. But within sight of the world's most famous summit, a grassroots movement is developing in the small town of Phaplu to help travellers experience the Himalayas in a new way and empower the local Sherpa people. While Mount Everest's record-breaking ascents and overcrowding often dominate headlines, a broader reality receives less attention: many Nepalis – including the Sherpas who work as seasonal guides and porters – struggle to secure stable year-round incomes. Sherpa guides can earn anywhere from 588,000 to 1,765,00 Nepalese rupees (£2,900 to £8,700) during the two-month climbing season. This is relatively high by Nepali standards, but it's a fraction of what Western guides employed by international operators earn for the same dangerous work. ""Despite their indispensable contributions, Sherpas often find themselves at the short end of the economic stick,"" wrote Lauren McKenna for The Borgen Project, an organisation addressing poverty. ""While expedition leaders and adventure companies reap substantial financial rewards from high-priced mountaineering expeditions, Sherpas receive meagre wages for their laborious work."" Against this backdrop, the nonprofit Phaplu Mountain Bike Club is betting that the region's dramatic peaks and pristine forests can attract more than elite climbers. The club has developed a network of 17 beginner- to expert-level trails stretching 70km in the community-managed Ratnange Forest, with the aim of creating local jobs that young Sherpa residents can design, lead and own. Founded in 2020 by hospitality director Ang Tshering Lama and French ex-pro mountain bike racer Tangi Rebours, the club collaborates with tour operators to bring novice mountain bikers and hardcore devotees alike to this north-eastern corner of the country. In 2023, it launched the annual Enduro Ratnange race, a four-day December event that now attracts international pros. As the trails have developed, Lama and Rebours have encouraged Sherpa families to open homestays, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in local culture. Bikers can also bed down in the lavish, 10-room Happy House lodge, owned by Lama's family and once favoured by legendary Everest mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary. ""I love mountain biking in Solukhumbu,"" said Mingmar, who also manages activities at Happy House. ""The air is clean, the people are warm and the terrain is wild in the best way. You can go from smooth single track to [a root-studded] technical descent, all while surrounded by some of the biggest mountains on Earth."" Mountain biking devotees have been aware of the sport's potential in Nepal for several decades. In 2003, Rebours co-founded Enduro MTB Nepal, which leads small-group, 14-day mountain biking trips in different regions, from Mustang to Solukhumbu. But in recent years, Phaplu's growing scene has attracted curious beginners, including myself. After two nights in Kathmandu, I took a 45-minute charter flight to Phaplu, where I stayed in a spacious room at Happy House, and spent an afternoon learning mountain biking basics courtesy of Nepali-owned Beyul Experiences. More like this: • The 109km trail opening up the Canadian Rockies • The Lower Dolpo Circuit: A 220km trek to the roof of the world • Chhurpi: The world's hardest cheese? ""Because of [the popularity of climbing] Mount Everest, we've always been deep in the shadows,"" Lama told me one evening. ""But projects like mountain biking have so much potential for communities to grow strong."" Thanks to funding from organisations including the Himalayan Trust and The Conscious Travel Foundation, the club obtained mountain bikes, built a new practice track and now trains local youth in everything from bike maintenance to first aid while teaching them how to guide fellow riders. One afternoon, I walked down to the track and watched a group of local boys  pedalling in figure-eight loops around banked turns. The soft tick of wheel spokes mingled with triumphant whoops. One of the boys was 17-year-old Ajay Kulung. ""I love being in the nature here,"" Kulung said, explaining what drew him to the sport. ""You can see a lot of things from the top of the mountains."" Behind me, 19-year-old Manisha BK was watching the riders. Before long, she too was on a bike, her pink fluffy sweater illuminated in the sunlight. ""There is huge growth potential for young people,"" Lama said. ""If you're starting as a mountain bike guide, you can earn $20 (£14.50) per day or more… The next generations can become entrepreneurs running touring companies, shopkeepers or mechanics – there's a huge demand for professional MTB mechanics in this country."" Globally, mountain biking is a $12.6bn industry – and it's estimated to double by 2032. Nepal's appeal lies in its mix of beginner-friendly and expert trails, mild weather and good terrain. ""The dirt is good quality here – the loam [forest dirt] is healthy and has good grip,"" Rebours said. ""You can ride here for 10-11 months of the year."" The Ratnange Forest's high elevation (3,280m) adds to the draw. Riding at altitude offers endurance benefits similar to those sought by elite athletes training in high-elevation regions elsewhere in the world. One morning I set out on a 3.5-hour hike to the top of Ratnange ridgeline to see the trails. In the spring heat, the evergreen needles under my boots smelled of warm pine, and pink rhododendron flowers lay on the ground like chewed bubblegum. Many of the trails follow old footpaths used by herders and farmers generations. Lama and Rebours told me that another benefit of the growing mountain biking scene here is that it dissuades illegal logging and hunting. The following day, a short drive took me to Garikhasa, a small village at the base of some of the club's trails, to meet locals who have opened homestays for foreign visitors. My first stop was the whitewashed home of Ang Babu Sherpa, his wife Ngima and their daughter, Pashi. As I approached, I passed a prayer wall hand-carved with Buddhist mantras, its edges softened with age and furred with red moss. Ngima welcomed me with hot tea and proudly told me that many visiting mountain bikers have enjoyed her traditional Sherpa dishes: nutritious shyakpa stew with broth, spinach, beef and corn; potato curries and lentil soups; and cheeses she makes with milk from the family's three cows. ""I was worried at first that they might not like my cooking,"" she said me. ""But they ate everything and promised to stay with me again for the next race. Everyone calls me 'Mom' when they stay here."" Next, I visited Dawa Sherpa, who moved back to Solukhumbu after living in Kathmandu and now helps manage the Phaplu Mountain Bike Club's logistics, including arranging shuttle transports and welcoming travellers to his own homestay. Dawa's goal is to help his family live in the area full-time and set his young children up for a successful lifestyle. ""I want my children to stay in this region, working and getting paid while living close by,"" he said. ""This is a peaceful place."" Everest still looms over the region – physically and economically. But as the Phaplu club continues to expand, more travellers and young Sherpas are turning their gaze away from the summit and towards these trails. In this quieter corner of the Himalayas, a different kind of adventure is taking shape. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

70,BBC,The Italian city where life is sweetest in winter,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260130-the-italian-city-where-life-is-sweetest-in-winter,"February is when much of Italy hibernates. But in Turin – an elegant ducal city at the foot of the Italian Alps – this frigid month is when the city comes alive. I live just outside the city and at this time of year, my calendar quickly fills with seasonal celebrations and long winter meals rooted in centuries-old tradition. The events are non-stop: first, our Carnival spills out onto neighbourhood streets, with parades, costumed figures and market-day performances appearing across the city. Soon after, CioccolaTò arrives in Piazza Vittorio Veneto. Finally, vermouth takes centre stage in historic cafés, bars and cultural venues. Every frosty event is punctuated by cosy wintertime food and drink. For travellers willing to rethink when to visit Italy, late winter in Turin is not a compromise season but the moment when everyday rituals are easiest to see. Here are some of the best ways to savour a February getaway in Turin. The first half of the month is the heart of Turin's Carnival season, with processions and lively neighbourhood celebrations playing out across the city between 1-15 February. One of the first places to encounter Turin's Carnival culture is the Balôn antiques market in Piazza Borgo Dora, held at weekends. Here, rows of vintage furniture, prints and curios sit alongside Carnival masks; while historical reenactments range from ancient Roman legions to medieval and Savoy-era characters, including the Rusnenta, the traditional Carnival mask of Borgo Dora whose name – meaning ""the ragged woman"" in local dialect – nods to the neighbourhood's long association with old objects and second-hand goods. I usually arrive in late morning once the market has found its rhythm and visit the nearby bakeries to stock up on Carnival pastries – like the traditional thin, crisp bugie dusted with icing sugar – to snack on while drifting between stalls and pausing at impromptu performances from brass bands and majorettes. For a more playful, family-oriented take on Carnival, head to Parco della Pellerina, home to Italy's largest Carnival funfair. During this period, Turin's traditional Carnival performers appear across the city, with Gianduja – Piedmont's sharp-witted everyman in a tricorn hat – and his companion Giacometta greeting passersby and posing for photographs. The celebrations reach their peak on 15 February on the River Po, when masked performers board a Venetian gondola and other boats, gliding toward the Murazzi riverfront for a closing ceremony. As Carnival's closing procession unfolds, Turin's sweetest event is already in full swing. CioccolaTò, Turin's annual chocolate festival, turns the vast riverside Piazza Vittorio Veneto into a cocoa-scented hub, with stalls and tastings in the square spilling into historic palaces and cultural sites for workshops, guided tours and film screenings. Piedmontese producers dominate, but chocolatiers from across Italy – and a smaller selection from abroad – also take part, making it an efficient way to sample styles. Long regarded as Italy's chocolate capital, the city's chocolate tradition dates to the 17th Century and lives on through its historic chocolatiers and cafes. Visitors can also board the Choco Tram, a vintage tram ride that links the city centre with Choco-Story Torino, an interactive museum tracing cocoa's global journey and Turin's role in shaping gianduja, the city's signature hazelnut-chocolate paste. Turin's iconic chocolate Gianduja emerged in the early 19th Century when local chocolatiers stretched scarce cocoa with finely ground hazelnuts. Its solid form, the giandujotto, was first distributed to the public during Carnival, its distinctive shape resembling Gianduja's tricorn hat. Today, nearly every café and pasticceria produces its own version, alongside house specialities such as Pfatisch's iconic chocolate-and-meringue cake, Il Festivo, that many Torinesi associate with celebrations. For a classic winter warm-up, order una tazza di bicerin (a layered blend of espresso, hot chocolate and cream) at Caffè Al Bicerin, a historic café facing the Santuario della Consolata where the drink originated in the 18th Century and is still prepared to the original recipe. ""In winter, people crave something rich, warm and indulgent, and there's nothing more comforting than sharing creamy hot chocolate or zabaglione with loved ones,"" says chocolatier Grazia Carelli, who has welcomed guests here for more than three decades. ""It fills the spirit, the heart and the body."" You can usually find a table outside; you may have to queue for the cosy interior, but it's worth the wait. As the month progresses, Turin turns to its other defining treat. Vermouth – first codified here in the late 18th Century – sits at the heart of the city's aperitivo culture. ""Today, Turinese people are rediscovering vermouth neat, with ice and a twist of lemon or orange peel, to let the nuances of each artisanal label emerge,"" says Laura Carello, founder and curator of the Salone del Vermouth, the city's annual festival dedicated to the aromatic fortified wine, which celebrates its 240th anniversary this year. Unlike elsewhere in Italy, she explains, ""the aperitif here is not a rushed interlude, but a slower, more deliberate part of the day"". Food, she adds, is meant to enhance the drink, not replace dinner – an inheritance of the merenda sinoira, the late-afternoon rural meal that the Savoyard capital gradually refined into a social ritual. In the week leading up to the two-day Salone del Vermouth at the Museo Nazionale del Risorgimento Italiano, the festival expands into a citywide Fuori Salone – a series of tastings, talks, masterclasses and special cocktail menus hosted across Turin's bars, restaurants and museums. The wider schedule also includes visits to places closely tied to vermouth history, such as the Museo Carpano inside Eataly Lingotto and Casa Martini, where guided tours trace the drink's production before ending with a tasting. Wine-lovers will enjoy Salone del Vino, a major regional wine fair that brings together hundreds of Piedmontese producers. For first-time visitors, it offers a compact introduction to the region's wines – from Barolo and Barbaresco to lesser-known alpine varieties – without leaving the city. Hearty and deeply traditional, Turin's cuisine is at its best in the cold months. Whenever I walk into a trattoria in February, I'm greeted by the unmistakable scent of slowly simmered meat, garlic, wine and cinnamon. At La Piola Sabauda, a traditional Piedmontese osteria in central Turin, chef and owner Roberto Forno says winter cooking in Piedmont is defined by ""intense, evocative aromas – food meant to wake up a dormant appetite and warm you from the inside"". Few dishes capture that spirit better than bagna cauda, the steaming garlic-and-anchovy sauce served in a single pot, into which diners dip raw and lightly cooked seasonal vegetables. ""Bagna cauda brings everyone back to the hearth,"" Forno says. ""It's about being together."" I usually warn first-timers that it's best enjoyed when they don't have pressing social engagements the next day. More like this: • Italy's strangest art town is getting a second chance • The European region with a 'split personality' • Italy's new nun-mapped pilgrim trail Winter menus also lean heavily on fonduta (a rich melted-cheese dish, served on its own or spooned over pasta, vegetables or eggs) and fritto misto (a mixed platter of lightly battered, fried meats, vegetables and sometimes fruit); while meat-lovers will find comfort in gran bollito misto (a procession of slow-simmered cuts served with green sauces) and veal brasato al Barolo, slowly braised in what locals call ""the king of wines, the wine of kings"". Meals often end with bunet, a dense chocolate-and-amaretto pudding that feels entirely in keeping with the season. For those keen to punctuate Turin's winter rituals with something louder, Ivrea offers a striking contrast. Around an hour by train, the town's historic Carnival builds through processions and ceremonies before erupting in the Battle of the Oranges, its best-known tradition. Held over three days from Carnival Sunday to Shrove Tuesday, the battle pits teams of aranceri (orange throwers) on foot against rivals riding in carts in a symbolic reenactment of a medieval revolt. I've watched from behind the safety nets and from inside the squares, close to the throwers and carts. It is loud, chaotic and strangely exhilarating. Locals share a few rules for first-time visitors: dress warmly, keep a cup of vin brûlé (Piedmont's mulled wine) close at hand, and wear the red berretto frigio – the Phrygian cap that signals neutrality – unless you're ready to join the fray. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

71,BBC,The mysterious football drink taking Ireland by storm,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260128-irelands-mysterious-non-boozy-football-drink,"Donegal's Football Special has been north-western Ireland's favourite underground non-alcoholic drink since the 1960s. And now the top-secret recipe is taking the nation by storm. I'm at a cafe in Ramelton, Donegal – a tiny town in Ireland's northernmost county – and I have no earthly clue what I'm drinking. The taste of vanilla hits first, then caramel. Or is it ginger? Liquorice, perhaps? I scan the bottle. The only thing it tells me is its name. This is Football Special, Donegal's beloved football drink, and its flavour is a deliberate mystery. Only two people in the world know its top-secret recipe – father and son Edward and Seamus McDaid, scions of the McDaid's & Sons soft drink company that created the refreshment 60 years ago. Mystery aside, the ""mixed-flavour soft drink"" (as it's officially billed) has been wildly popular since its inception – and equally inescapable in the county's pubs and restaurants. ""You always get it, no matter where you go,"" said Katie McCallum, receptionist at Mulroy Woods Hotel on the outskirts of Ramelton. Despite its popularity, Football Special has remained Donegal's delicious secret, available only in remote north-western Ireland – until now. The baffling concoction is seeing a surge in popularity across the country, with sales of Football Special doubling in five years, according to the company. ""Did we expect this?"" said Edward. ""Did we what?! No. We didn't."" As a Dubliner, I only first came across Football Special while holidaying near County Donegal's Slieve League cliffs. Its football branding piqued my curiosity; then so did its taste. ""I wouldn't even know how to describe it,"" said Ramelton bartender Jordan McDaid. ""[It's like] cola, but there's a sweeter taste to it."" The legend of Football Special dates to the 1960s; a heady time in Ramelton history when its football club Swilly Rovers FC scored two Football Association of Ireland Junior Cup wins. In those days, it was Irish custom to celebrate football victories by pouring booze into trophies and drinking communally from the cup. ""My grandfather and his brothers were all heavily involved in the Swilly Rovers,"" said Seamus. Because the siblings felt that sobriety bred better athletes, ""they wanted to create a product they could 'fill the cup' with that was non-alcoholic"". Football Special was a hit throughout Ramelton, soon filling pubs and shops across the county beyond footy season. At his home on the fringes of Ramelton, Edward showed me a book of McDaid's 1960s drink recipes, handwritten by his father, James. One is an early formula for Football Special, then known as ""Football Cup"". ""I won't let you see the recipe,"" he said. ""Sorry, I'd have to kill you!"" What the McDaids will say is that Football Special is comprised of seven undisclosed flavours, and that when it was invented, the company avoided disclosing formulas to protect them from replication. ""Lots of people did imitate it from a flavour point of view,"" said Edward, ""[but they] could never really crack it to the same extent."" Eventually, the mysterious ingredients ""became a fun quirk of the product"", said Seamus. ""If there's a mixed element to it… it makes more sense to be secret."" Edward gave Seamus, now in his mid-30s, the recipe without fanfare, passing it on to him a few years ago while they were developing a Football Special-flavoured ice cream. The duo takes the task of guardianship seriously. ""My wife doesn't even know the recipe,"" said Seamus. He added: ""Myself and my dad are not allowed to travel in the same aeroplane now."" It's a joke. Maybe. The McDaid brothers deliberately formulated Football Special to resemble beer, adding a heading agent to create a thick foam. ""I like to say now we were the original zero-alcohol beer long before anybody else thought of it,"" said Seamus. However unique, Football Special was just part of a wave of soft drinks developed in mid-20th-Century Ireland, often called ""minerals"" for their spring water content. The boom stemmed from a trend of teetotalism, said Dr Máirtín Mac Con Iomaire, co-editor of the book, Irish Food History: A Companion. ""We had a huge number of pioneers in Ireland at that time"". Mac Con Iomaire noted that Rock Shandy – an orange and lemon soda – was created in Dublin's O'Rourke's pub during the same era, while cider brand Bulmers launched apple drink Cidona. By the 1980s, Football Special had become a top seller for McDaid's & Sons. Demand for their orange, lemonade and cola offerings dropped as global brands like Coca-Cola began to dominate the market for generic flavours. Irish competitors such as Cavan Cola and Dwan's Soft Drinks also fell by the wayside. ""That's why [we've] survived,"" said Seamus. ""There's nothing else that tastes like Football Special."" Donegal has historically been referred to as Ireland's ""forgotten county"" due to its geographical remoteness, said Lyndsey Reynolds of Food Coast Donegal. But Seamus believes the drink's Donegal roots are central to its success. ""The locals in Donegal are very proud and are very loyal customers."" Ramelton is found on Donegal's rugged Fanad Peninsula. Located on the banks of the River Lennon, the town is characterised by handsome Georgian architecture, built during the heyday of its linen-bleaching and maritime industry. Football Special is everywhere, from the butchers to the pubs. A weathered sign hangs on the Victorian port buildings, encouraging passersby to ""Drink Football Special"". Every local resident has a memory. ""For special occasions… it was always Football Special that was drank,"" said Shauna Toland. It reminds Áine Friel of her grandfather's pub: ""Every time we went in, we would always get the Football Special."" McCallum remembers bringing it to university in Limerick. ""It's like another connection to home, to Donegal."" Swilly Rovers players still pour it into the trophy after wins, added Anna McFadden, manager of the senior women's team. ""It's usually done in the pub once the game is all wrapped up."" ""It's a drink that is part of the fabric of the county,"" said Reynolds. It explains the drink's tagline: ""World Famous in Donegal."" Facing lagging sales, McDaid's & Sons bolstered its marketing strategy in 2020, building advertising campaigns around the drink's heritage and creating merchandise like branded ""retro"" jerseys. It worked: consumers throughout Ireland began seeking out the brand. Mac Con Iomaire suspects the drink's wave of national popularity is part of a wider movement, with consumers favouring Irish brands as ""a reaction to the globalisation process where people want to feel in touch with the local heritage, be it language, music, food or indeed Football Special"". Case in point: in 2020 McDaid's & Sons sold 13,000 cases of Football Special. In 2025, they sold 27,000. Many new devotees remark that Football Special reminds them of soft drinks they enjoyed in childhood. ""People are nostalgic for Football Special who've never actually had Football Special,"" said Seamus. Jason Corrigan, who owns Corrigan's Butchers in Dublin, was introduced to the drink by a former employee. ""It's lovely,"" he said. ""It just reminds me of my youth… sitting at home, having lemonade with ice cream thrown in on top of it."" Having stocked Football Special ever since he first tried it, Corrigan reports that his customers buy two-litre bottles to take home with them. Dubliner Rob Keogh discovered it in Bang Bang cafe in the city's Phibsborough district. ""I like the idea of supporting a local soft drink producer, rather than the big multinational companies we generally associate with the sector,"" he said. ""It tastes unique too, with hints of cola and cream soda and god knows what."" While football is integral to the drink's origin story, nowadays it has little bearing on how people drink it (aside from Swilly Rovers' post-match celebrations). ""I would just drink it for the flavour,"" said McCallum. The mystery of its recipe is ""part of its appeal"", she suspects. ""You can't really describe what it is to someone until they have to try it as well because it's such an unusual flavour."" More like this: • The controversial sweet that fuels Norwegians • Noche Buena: the Mexican beer you can only buy at Christmas • The divisive US autumnal drink with a shady past That this unique flavour is spreading nationwide is a source of pride for Donegal residents. ""Everyone's probably really proud of it,"" McCallum said. ""It's definitely a good thing for Ramelton and for Donegal."" Limited runs with supermarket giant Lidl are bringing Football Special across the Emerald Isle and beyond. Belfast's The Reporter bar now serves it, and you can have it with pizza at The Dough Bros in Galway. It's sold in stores in Glasgow and the US's East Coast, popular among members of the Irish diaspora. ""Multiple generations are drinking it,"" said Isobel Williams, the company's marketing coordinator. Its rise in popularity coincides with dropping alcohol consumption rates across Ireland. A report by Drinks Ireland found that non-alcoholic beer sales in Ireland shot up by 25% in 2024 and there has been a widely reported trend in eschewing alcohol among Ireland's Gen Z cohort. ""[It's] a good alternative to alcoholic drinks when you're out, definitely,"" said McCallum, herself a Gen Zedder. ""If you're a designated driver, it is something you'd be more inclined to reach for."" Ramelton bartender McDaid agrees: ""It would be commonly drunk in the bar. Especially for people outside of the county, they come up to try Football Special.” But wherever you sip that maddeningly elusive flavour, the best place to enjoy Football Special is still in Donegal; the wild and beautiful county that has sustained this drink over generations. -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

72,BBC,The biggest all-you-can-eat buffet in the world,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260119-the-all-you-can-eat-buffet-thats-frances-favourite-restaurant,"France's highest-grossing restaurant isn't a Michelin-starred bistro or a Parisian institution, but an all-you-can-eat buffet on the outskirts of Narbonne. Serving everything from pressed duck to truffles for just €67.50 (£58.74), Les Grands Buffets has become a national obsession and a pilgrimage for French food lovers. As I pulled into a nondescript carpark opposite a McDonald's on the outskirts of Narbonne, in southern France, I didn't expect that in less than half an hour I would be watching one of the most revered rituals of French culinary theatre. To the swelling soundtrack of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries, a server emerged wearing a crisp white shirt and black apron, holding a whole roasted duck skewered vertically above a naked flame. He presented it to the assembled diners as if bearing the Olympic torch. Then a deep, dramatic voice rang out: ""Ladies and gentlemen, this is the ritual of canard au sang, a tradition conceived in the 19th Century. The duck is roasted on the spit and then brought to the table, where the duck master uses a silver duck press to crush the carcass, extracting the blood and natural juices, which are then incorporated into the sauce."" I watched as the duck was filleted on a marble workbench; the bones placed in a silver press and crushed. A dark liquid, unmistakably blood, trickled out, was flambéed and poured back over the meat. However queasy it made me feel, there was no doubt that this is one of the great classics of French gastronomy – and one that rarely appears menus today, let along prepared with such ceremony. In fact, there is only one restaurant in France that serves pressed duck at every lunch and dinner service. And that's exactly where I was: Les Grands Buffets. Literally translated as ""The Big Buffets"", Les Grands Buffets is exactly what it sounds like: an all-you-can-eat restaurant – and the largest of its kind in the world. Yet it's about as far removed from the suburban buffets of my Australian childhood as it is possible to be. Those certainly didn't feature a seven-tiered lobster fountain, nine varieties of foie gras, more than 50 desserts or hold the world record for the most varieties of cheese commercially available in a restaurant (111, to be precise). All of this comes for a fixed price of €67.50 (£58.78/ $79.17) per person. Founded in 1989 by Louis and Jane Privat, Les Grands Buffets has become one of France's most coveted dining experiences – a place many French people hope to visit at least once in their lives. Reservations are made months in advance, and diners willingly make the pilgrimage to Narbonne, a town of around 56,000 people near the Spanish border. The restaurant welcomes around 400,000 diners a year – 86% of them French – and receives some 3.5 million reservation requests annually. With its 2025 revenue totalling €30m (£26m/$34.8m), it's also France's highest-grossing restaurant. ""When we opened, there wasn't a single all-you-can-eat buffet in France,"" Louis Privat told me as we toured the restaurant before the lunch service. ""The concept just didn't exist."" Others had tried, he said, but found the model financially unviable. ""Yet, what was very famous at that time was Club Med and its buffet."" A qualified accountant, Privat believed he could make the concept stick. ""I was a real fan of the formula, and I was sure that the general public would adore it, too."" The French, after all, have long embraced all-inclusive holidays. They are also fiercely proud of their national cuisine. Les Grands Buffets sits precisely at the intersection of those two impulses. As the restaurant evolved, Privat discovered that, almost unintentionally, it was spotlighting recipes from a single chef above all others. ""I am deeply attached to traditional cuisine,"" he said. ""So I asked our chefs to focus on classic dishes: tripe, daube [a Provençal stew], snails. One day, I realised that all the recipes we were working with were recorded in Auguste Escoffier's Le Guide Culinaire."" Often described as the father of modern French cuisine, Escoffier codified classical French cooking at the turn of the 20th Century. His Guide Culinaire, first published in 1903, remains a foundational reference for chefs worldwide. In 2024, both Privat and executive chef Philippe Munos were inducted as disciples of Escoffier by the Fondation Auguste Escoffier, which preserves the chef's legacy. The foundation also recognised Les Grands Buffets as a Vitrine Mondiale de la Cuisine d'Auguste Escoffier, or a ""global showcase for Auguste Escoffier's cuisine"". ""The restaurant is genuinely done in the spirit of Auguste Escoffier,"" said Michel Escoffier, the chef's great-grandchild and honorary chairman of the foundation That spirit continues to shape the menu. Late last year, Les Grands Buffets introduced truffles, making it the only all-you-can-eat buffet in the world to serve the prized and pricey ingredient, according to Privat. ""Since Escoffier presents 1,200 truffle recipes in his repertoire, we felt that if we are to continue to be recognised as the global showcase of his cuisine, we had to feature truffles,"" he said. At the dedicated truffle station, I picked up a truffle and foie gras soup topped with puff pastry, as well as a plate of organic scrambled eggs finished with generous shavings of black truffle. The dish was cooked in front of me at a wide, polished wood counter. I was struck by how very civilised it all was. There were no elbows out at the lobster fountain, and people served themselves a respectful half-dozen oysters at a time rather than piling a mountain onto their plates. They queued patiently for hot dishes made to order – an indulgent list that included poached lobster, tournedos Rossini (beef filet with truffle and foie gras) and a south-western French classic, cassoulet from nearby Castelnaudary. Around 150 dishes are drawn directly from Le Guide Culinaire, each annotated with its original page number. I was careful to pace myself as I didn't want to miss out on cheese and dessert; luckily, diners are given time to let courses settle. For the lunch service, guests arrive in 15-minute increments from noon and can stay until 16.30. At dinner, doors open at 19:00 and close at midnight. Beyond the food, Les Grands Buffets also celebrates the arts de la table, or the staging and setting of a meal. Privat has assembled an impressive collection of French culinary heritage, including a silver Christofle duck press from Paris' legendary La Tour d'Argent restaurant, purchased at auction for €40,000 ($46,432) in 2016, and a silver trolley from Nice's Belle Epoque icon, Le Negresco, now used to prepare crêpes Suzettes tableside. Four dining rooms branch off from the main service area, where tables are set with white tablecloths, polished cutlery and glassware. Each has its own theme; one is named for British sculpture artist Ann Carrington, whose works hang in institutions such as London's Victoria & Albert Museum. Privat purchased one of her bouquets, made out of cutlery, from her stand at Portobello Market a decade ago; it now occupies pride of place in the room. More like this: • Is the future of French cheese at stake? • Why France's most elaborate and macabre recipe is back on the menu • Sorry, France, the world's best bubbly is British ""He had a good eye as he chose the best piece,"" said Carrington. ""The restaurant is also the perfect location for a sculpture made from cutlery, how fitting!"" But I couldn't leave without asking about wastage. Privat, forever the accountant, he has meticulously tracked exactly how much people eat: for instance, an average of 49g of foie gras per person. Leftovers from the buffet are kept for the team; more than 100 employees receive lunch and dinner every day. And while some waste is inevitable, it remains minimal: ""We throw out 10kg a day and serve 1,000 people, so that's 10g per person wastage,"" Privat said. Food fashions, he added, matter little when the menu is rooted in classics. That said, the restaurant has upped its macaron production in recent years to 500,000 annually and is about to scrap the crudités counter. ""No one eats them anymore,"" he shrugged. Change is also coming to the building itself. Privat is undertaking a multi-million-euro expansion, working with French architect Jacques Garcia on a new entrance styled like a gallery from the Napoléon III-era. He is also opening a boutique selling regional crafts. Despite its low-slung exterior – easily mistaken for a bowling alley – the Narbonne location remains key to its success. ""We couldn't afford to be increasing in size if we were in Paris,"" Privat said. Today, Les Grands Buffets is one of Narbonne's biggest tourism drivers. Diners spend an average of 3.5 days in town, exploring Roman remains and a soaring Gothic cathedral alongside their reservation. ""Les Grands Buffets couldn't be anywhere else,"" said Carol Delga, president of the Regional Council of the Occitanie region, where Narbonne is situated. ""Occitanie is the land of eating well."" She believes its appeal lies in access, offering people the opportunity to taste products they don't usually encounter in everyday life. She adds: ""And when a restaurant offers the world's largest cheese platter, it's enough to make anyone want to visit – and to come back again."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

73,BBC,The secret Japanese snack bars hidden in plain sight,https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20260116-inside-the-secret-world-of-japanese-snack-bars,"Some 100,000 of these small dives are hidden in plain sight across Japan. Now, travellers are finally discovering these locals-only hangouts – and the beloved ""mamas"" who run them. I didn't plan on having my fortune read by a matchmaking ""mama"" on my most recent visit to Tokyo. But after climbing to the second floor of a cozy sunakku (snack bar) called Aeru in the Shinbashi neighbourhood, the proprietress and owner, Urara, smiled coyly as she pulled a Knight of Wands from her tarot deck. ""You're craving passion and protection… in a man,"" Urara told me, as I nibbled chilli-flavoured rice crackers and deep-fried dough sticks slathered in brown sugar. ""I'll be sure to let my husband know that,"" I replied with a wry smile. As she thumbed through a three-ring binder filled with the handwritten profiles of Japanese singles in their 20s and 30s, Urara explained that she has successfully matched more than 90 couples during the 14 years she has worked here. While her tarot readings and modern matchmaking techniques are unique among Japan's tens of thousands of snack bars, Urara embodies what makes these small venues so distinct. Usually run by an older woman known affectionately as a mama-san, snack bars are nondescript, no-frills bars serving light bites and drinks. But as I soon learned, their main purpose isn't food or booze; it's to create a space where patrons feel comfortable enough to open up, engage in meaningful conversation and genuinely connect with the mama-san who presides over the room. ""Unlike the bars or nightclubs many tourists may imagine, snack bars are warm, home-like places,"" said Mayuko Igarashi, president and director of Snack Yokocho Culture Inc, which has been offering tours of snack bars across Japan for travellers since 2021. ""The 'mama'… welcomes guests with a sense of personal care."" A far cry from the pricey ""hostess clubs"" found in entertainment districts like Kabukichō in Shinjuku, where young women are paid generously to pour drinks and flirt with customers, snack bars – or simply ""snacks"", as they're more commonly known – have played an integral role in Japan's nightlife for more than half a century. Often tucked along alleyways in cities and suburban neighbourhoods, snack bars have long been beloved by locals of all ages. Loyal regulars come to snack on simple bar food – from senbei (rice crackers) and pickles to homemade dishes like karaage (fried chicken) and yakisoba noodles – over a drink, socialising in a non-flirtatious way. Despite their convivial atmosphere, these neighbourhood haunts have historically operated outside the public eye, relying on word of mouth rather than walk-in trade. That semi-private, almost members-only quality lies at the heart of their appeal. As Igarashi explained, mama-sans cultivate a sense of trust and familiarity, creating spaces where guests feel safe to open up. ""We often describe snack bars as places where you can experience Japan's drinking culture in the most intimate and approachable way,"" she said. ""Even if you visit for the first time, you can feel as if you've been invited into a friend’s home."" Snack bars emerged during Japan's post-World War Two-era recovery. As the nation rapidly rebuilt its cities, encouraged longer working hours and implemented stricter alcohol regulations, bars began cleverly bypassing these rules by serving simple bar food (""snacks"") and offering spaces where a new class of businessmen could come and confide in female owners. Tokyo-area resident and local tour guide Jeffrey Garrish explained that the mama-sans benefitted too. ""In the enormous economic challenges of the time, there were few good options for women, whether they be widowers, young ladies or even sometimes men (though very rare), so starting an establishment that served alcohol in small spaces became a decent option,"" he said. By the late 1960s, women-run snack bars had proliferated nationwide. Originally, these humble neighbourhood fixtures offered little more than a counter with a few stools, a radio and a small kitchen where home-style dishes were served with whisky, beer and highballs (Japanese whisky and soda water). As Western culture increasingly poured into the nation in the 1970s and 1980s, and glitzy nightclubs and discos took over Japan's major entertainment districts, snack bars began to flourish as a quieter, more intimate alternative. They became community hubs, drawing in salarymen and regulars craving conversation, familiarity and a sense of belonging. Many ""snacks"" adopted a unique bottle-keep (botoru kiipu) system that still exists, where regulars purchase a bottle of whisky or shōchū (a homegrown Japanese spirit), label it and store it behind the bar for future visits. This custom turned a casual drink at the local snack into a lasting relationship. More like this: • The Japanese city for people seeking love • An insider's guide to the best sushi in Tokyo • Why you should visit Japan's small but mighty 'little Kyoto' Today, it's believed that roughly 100,000 snack bars operate across Japan – which, as Igarashi noted, is more than double the number of the nation's ubiquitous konbinis (convenience stores). A self-described ""snack enthusiast"", she has visited more than 1,200 snacks bars across Japan. In 2021, she started offering tours to snack bars to connect younger Japanese residents and travellers with places they either might be too intimidated to enter – or, in the case of foreigners, never knew existed. ""In many towns, I witnessed travellers and regulars laughing together while the mama treated everyone like a family for the night,"" Igarashi said. ""Because of this, we created the [snack tours] as a gentle guide – [like] someone who opens the cultural door for new visitors."" Part confidant, part counsellor, the charismatic mama-sans behind the bars can always be counted on to solicit everything from life advice to – in the case of Urara-mama – love advice and fortunes. ""The mama-san is the founder, operator, manager and everything in between,"" Garrish told me. ""The mama-san curates the experience, from her first greetings to the questions she asks you when you sit down. She is selling her time, attention and affection."" Visit a snack bar Snack Yokocho offers small, guided snack bar tours in Tokyo, Osaka and other major Japanese cities. Garrish also offers snack bar tours in Tokyo and Atami through Discover Japan. For independent exploring, neighbourhoods such as Shimbashi in Tokyo are home to a number of snack bars, with some listed on Google Maps or Instagram. Look for handwritten signs reading ""snack"" or ""snack bar"" in English, or the characters スナック(sunakku) or スナックバ (""snack bar""). Most snack bars charge a small entrance fee (""otoshi"") that includes a welcome snack. In recent years, Garrish says he's noticed more travellers interested in seeking out deeper, more personal connections to Japanese culture. With that has come an uptick in visitors seeking out snack bars that were traditionally locals-only but are now starting to open their doors to curious and respectful outsiders. Yet, Igarashi explained that snack bars have also faced challenges. In the years leading up to Covid, snack bars' popularity started to wane as karaoke bars and chain izakayas (pubs) proliferated, younger generations drank less alcohol and ageing mama-sans retired without successors. In response, many snack bars have adapted to welcome new customers while preserving what makes these communal spaces so unique. ""Snack bars have continued to evolve over the years. [They have gone] from a place for workers to relax or escape from the hardships after the war to a place to counterbalance the stresses and pressure of Japan during… the country's bubble years between the mid '80s/early '90s,"" Garrish said. ""Now they're reinventing themselves once again in the digital age to embrace what has always made them special: connections to people, spending time together and ultimately the comfort and conversation with the mama-san."" In cities and suburbs, a steady resurgence is underway. Today, you can find anime-themed snacks and others that now use social media to attract newcomers, rather than relying solely on word-of-mouth. Garrish noted that this new openness has brought greater inclusivity, with more snack bars welcoming LGBTQ+ guests and creating safer, more diverse spaces. As Igarashi put it, they also offer a welcome respite from the pressures of digital life. ""Younger generations are drawn to snack bars because they offer real, human connection – something that social media cannot provide,"" she said. As Garish explained, it's that connection and the conversations with mama-sans that keeps drawing locals – and increasingly visitors – back. ""I've had many [travellers] tell me that some of their best memories in Japan have been made in snack bars, and these people were paying thousands of dollars for fancy hotels, geisha experiences, craft classes and sushi classes,"" he said. ""So, I would always suggest taking that leap of faith, opening that dark and intimidating door and just walking in to ask for an open seat."" -- If you liked this story, sign up for The Essential List newsletter – a handpicked selection of features, videos and can't-miss news, delivered to your inbox twice a week.

74,BBC,Meet the women protecting India's snow leopards,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g05xg1qzeo,"In one of India's coldest and most remote regions, a group of women have taken on an unlikely role: protecting one of Asia's most elusive predators, the snow leopard. Snow leopards are found in just 12 countries across Central and South Asia. India is home to one of the world's largest populations, with a nationwide survey in 2023 - the first comprehensive count ever carried out in the country - estimating more than 700 animals, . One of the places they roam is around Kibber village in Himachal Pradesh state's Spiti Valley, a stark, high-altitude cold desert along the Himalayan belt. Here, snow leopards are often called the ""ghosts of the mountains"", slipping silently across rocky slopes and rarely revealing themselves. For generations, the animals were seen largely as a threat, for attacking livestock. But attitudes in Kibber and neighbouring villages are beginning to shift, as people increasingly recognise the snow leopard's role as a top predator in the food chain and its importance in maintaining the region's fragile mountain ecosystem. Nearly a dozen local women are now working alongside the Himachal Pradesh forest department and conservationists to track and protect the species, playing a growing role in conservation efforts. Locally, the snow leopard is known as Shen and the women call their group ""Shenmo"". Trained to install and monitor camera traps, they handle devices fitted with unique IDs and memory cards that automatically photograph snow leopards as they pass. ""Earlier, men used to go and install the cameras and we kept wondering why couldn't we do it too,"" says Lobzang Yangchen, a local coordinator working with a small group supported by the non-profit Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) in collaboration with the forest department. Yangchen was among the women who helped collect data for Himachal Pradesh's snow leopard survey in 2024, which found that the state was home to 83 snow leopards - up from 51 in 2021. The survey documented snow leopards and 43 other species using camera traps spread across an area of nearly 26,000sq km (10,000sq miles). Individual leopards were identified by the unique rosette patterns on their fur, a standard technique used for spotted big cats. The findings are now feeding into wider conservation and habitat-management plans. ""Their contribution was critical to identifying individual animals,"" says Goldy Chhabra, deputy conservator of forests with the Spiti Wildlife Division. Collecting the data is demanding work. Most of it takes place in winter, when heavy snowfall pushes snow leopards and their prey to lower altitudes, making their routes easier to track. On survey days, the women wake up early, finish household chores and gather at a base camp before travelling by vehicle as far as the terrain allows. From there, they trek several kilometres to reach camera sites, often at altitudes above 14,000ft (4,300m), where the thin air makes even simple movement exhausting. The BBC accompanied the group on one such trek in December. After hours of walking in biting cold, the women suddenly stopped on a narrow trail. Yangchen points to pugmarks in the dust: ""This shows the snow leopard has been here recently. These pugmarks are fresh."" Along with pugmarks, the team looks for other signs, including scrapes and scent‑marking spots, before carefully fixing a camera to a rock along the trail. One woman then carries out a ""walk test"", crawling along the path to check whether the camera's height and angle will capture a clear image. The group then moves on to older sites, retrieving memory cards and replacing batteries installed weeks earlier. By mid-afternoon, they return to camp to log and analyse the images using specialised software - tools many had never encountered before. ""I studied only until grade five,"" says Chhering Lanzom. ""At first, I was scared to use the computer. But slowly, we learned how to use the keyboard and mouse."" The women joined the camera-trapping programme in 2023. Initially, conservation was not their motivation. But winters in the Spiti Valley are long and quiet, with little agricultural work to fall back on. ""At first, this work on snow leopards didn't interest us,"" Lobzang says. ""We joined because we were curious and we could earn a small income."" The women earn between 500 ($5.46; £4) and 700 rupees a day. But beyond the money, the work has helped transform how the community views the animal. ""Earlier, we thought the snow leopard was our enemy,"" says Dolma Zangmo, a local resident. ""Now we think their conservation is important."" Alongside survey work, the women help villagers access government insurance schemes for their livestock and promote the use of predator‑proof corrals - stone or mesh enclosures that protect animals at night. Their efforts come at a time of growing recognition for the region. Spiti Valley has recently been included in the Cold Desert Biosphere Reserve, a Unesco-recognised network aimed at conserving fragile ecosystems while supporting local livelihoods. As climate change reshapes the fragile trans-Himalayan landscape, conservationists say such community participation will be crucial to safeguarding species like the snow leopard. ""Once communities are involved, conservation becomes more sustainable,"" says Deepshikha Sharma, programme manager with NCF's High Altitudes initiative. ""These women are not just assisting, they are becoming practitioners of wildlife conservation and monitoring,"" she adds. As for the women, their work makes them feel closer to their home, the village and the mountains that raised them, they say. ""We were born here, this is all we know,"" Lobzang says. ""Sometimes we feel afraid because these snow leopards are after all predatory animals, but this is where we belong."" Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook.

75,BBC,"IOC must 'be better' on climate change, chief says",https://www.bbc.com/sport/articles/cwyg4xw283no,"Kirsty Coventry (centre left) was elected IOC president in March 2025 International Olympic Committee president Kirsty Coventry says it must ""be better"" on climate change after receiving a petition signed by more than 21,000 people who want to stop fossil fuel companies from sponsoring winter sports. The petition - delivered on Wednesday and with athletes among the signatories - comes as Italy's Eni, one of the world's seven biggest oil companies, is a 'premium partner' of the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. It follows reports that the number of countries which could reliably host a Winter Olympics will hugely reduce in the future because of climate change. Asked by the BBC whether she is disappointed by the Games having high-carbon sponsors, Coventry said: ""It's really nice athletes have a platform to speak up. ""The petition, I know they met with our team today and we are having conversations in order to be better, and for our stakeholders to be better. But that takes time."" Winter Olympics 2026 Milan-Cortina, February 6-22 02/02/26 Christophe Dubi, the IOC executive director for the Olympic Games, added: ""We make a point to receive those petitions, and we have to recognise climate is a challenge for all of us. ""What we have to do as an organisation is to be at the forefront of sustainability, and our principles are very clear."" One area the IOC is aiming to make the Olympics more sustainable is having Games take place over a wider area with more pre-existing facilities, and Coventry said Milan-Cortina is an acid test for whether this is a viable future. Milan-Cortina takes place in three hubs spread across northern Italy - in Milan, Cortina and Livigno - with only two newly built sporting facilities: the Santagiulia ice hockey arena and Cortina Sliding Centre. The next two Winter Olympics - French Alps 2030 and Utah 2034 - will also have sports spread more widely, while the 2032 Summer Olympics in Brisbane is will have venues across Queensland. This has caused issues however, with Brisbane organisers saying, external they will go beyond the originally stated budget of $4.9bn (Â£3.6bn). ""We are really experiencing a spread out Games here for the first time - we are going to learn a lot,"" Coventry said. ""We have taken this decision for sustainability reasons, climate and not having to have new venues. We are seeing there is an impact on National Olympic Committees because of the spreadness [sic], also for broadcast and media, making it harder to get around. ""What is really cool is that you get to see iconic venues in beautiful places - but now we have to weigh this up, the balance between a spread games for sustainability reasons but not shifting complexity and sustainability to different areas."" While the action got underway on Wednesday with the start of the curling events, the 2026 Winter Olympics will officially start with the opening ceremony on Friday. Coventry said she hoped all nations would be treated with respect by spectators, including the USA team amid criticism from Italian authorities about the presence of ICE agents in Milan. ""I hope the opening ceremony is seen by everyone as a chance to be respectful,"" she said. ""For me, when we went to the Olympic village that is the best reminder of how the Games should be. I hope the opening ceremony will do that."" Fear and Hall named 2026 Team GB flagbearers Russian athletes linked to pro-war activity Quiz: Name every sport at the 2026 Winter Olympics"
76,BBC,Why a beauty spot in South Africa could be about to run out of water,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8pleg24rvo,"Fears that the taps in the South African tourist resort of Knysna, with its turquoise water, sandy beaches and pleasant weather, could soon run dry - a moment known as ""day zero"" - have prompted a state of disaster to be declared. It is a scary prospect for the 100,000 residents who live in an area situated along South Africa's famous Garden Route, a 150km (93-mile) stretch of seaside towns with forested and mountainous scenery on the southern coast. But it is the latest South African town to be hit by a severe water crisis, caused by the failure to maintain infrastructure and changing weather patterns. Beneath the pretty veneer of Knysna - which is also a retirement haven for more affluent South Africans - its water system is on the brink of collapse. Official estimates suggest that around 55% of the town's drinkable water is lost to leaking pipes. It is a problem compounded by the fact that the town has been hit by a drought, leading to a sharp drop in water levels at its main storage dam. When we visited the area last week, Akkerkloof dam had just 20 days' worth of reserves. But it is not clear when exactly ""day zero"" will hit as the authorities have stepped in with water restrictions and emergency funding. A retirement centre in Knysna has already experienced its version of ""day zero"" - when a fault at a local municipal plant left the elderly residents without any water for 10 days last October. This prompted owner, Franco de Grandis, to invest in a back-up water supply for the facility. ""We need water in the apartments; we need water when people are bedridden in nappies. Without water, we cannot function,"" he told the BBC. He has spent around 250,000 South African rand ($15,700; £11,400) on the new operation, which includes three 10,000-litre water storage tanks and specialised pressure pumps to feed that water into some of main buildings, whenever there are water outages. ""We had to make out own plan, I knew I couldn't allow our residents to experience something like that again,"" he said. Non-governmental organisations like Gift of the Givers have also stepped in to throw a lifeline to residents who cannot afford back-up measures. From privately dug boreholes, they bring thousands of litres of water in tankers almost daily to the town. ""There is serious gratitude from the people when we arrive,"" Gift of the Givers' local co-ordinator Mario Ferreira told the BBC. ""The disturbing thing is [that] the people start thinking this is the way of life and it shouldn't be,"" Ferreira added. There are fears queuing for water rations will become a reality unless a solution is found. ""Water is a basic right. It's frustrating that the town has come to this,"" De Grandis said. In office for 11 months, Mayor Thando Matika acknowledges the problems, but is quick to point out that he inherited them from his predecessors. ""The municipality has for years not been doing maintenance. They said there was no money. Even the boreholes dug in 2009 were not working anymore,"" he told the BBC. His council has now received an emergency cash boost from the national government of $1.25m to deal with the crisis. Plans include fixing the town's seven boreholes and desalination plant as well as drilling for an extra borehole in the short term. Looking at how to recycle water and building another dam are part of its longer-term focus. ""Hydrologists are in town looking at that process,"" the mayor explained. Water meters will be also be installed in homes where there are none or they have been broken. Restrictions were put in place in January, including reducing the town's water pressure and people are banned from watering gardens, filling pools and washing boats with municipal water. Water is rationed to 50 litres per person per day - to put that into perspective, the average person in the UK uses 142 litres a day, according to Water UK. Though talk of the ""day zero"" has made those in the tourism business edgy. ""The name 'day zero' can inspire panic and seems threatening,"" said Elmay Bouwer, who heads the tourism section of the Great Knysna Business Council and also runs a bed and breakfast. ""We should instead tell people how to preserve the water we have. We tell the international tourists about the restrictions, but we also want to make sure they have a good time here. ""It's about respecting the resources, not scaring people."" Yet experts say South Africa needs to be scared out of its complacency. Cape Town, South Africa's second-largest city, infamously came close to ""day zero"" in the drought of 2018. ""I definitely think we're going to see more and more reports of towns struggling with water security,"" Dr Ferial Adam of campaign group Watercan told the BBC. ""For some millions in South Africa, 'day zero' is every day, it exists now. Half of the population do not have running water in their homes,"" she said. ""That tells us there is an access issue, on top of that access issue you have infrastructure that's been allowed to go to ruin, as well as climate change changes across the country. ""You combine all those factors - and you get what we're sitting with which is a melting pot of problems."" This is reflected in Khayalethu township, a short drive from the picturesque town of Knysna. Irregular water supply there is a part of life, but the residents say the ""day-zero anxiety"" has at least brought attention to their daily struggle. ""You cannot live without water, but we're often left without it for days at a time,"" 60-year-old Khanyiswa Sewula tells the BBC. ""I'm an old woman, and struggle to walk… but I am forced to carry a bucket to where the municipal tankers park, if I want to have water in my home.""

77,BBC,UK launches plan to tackle 'forever chemicals' amid growing concerns,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9vz249keno,"The UK is to increase testing for so-called ""forever chemicals"" in the environment as part of a national plan to tackle the substances, which have prompted environmental and health concerns. The group of chemicals, also known as PFAS, are used in many everyday products because of their oil resistant and waterproof properties. But scientists are concerned because their chemical structures mean they accumulate and remain in the environment, with a small number of PFAS known to be toxic. The government says that by 2029 it wants to align more closely with regulations issued by the EU, which is looking to prohibit all non-essential uses. Some environmental groups and the water industry have urged the government to act more quickly in banning the chemicals. But new regulations currently take around five years to put in place, and the Chemicals Industries Association has said there are some critical industries such as hydrogen production where there are few alternatives. Forever chemicals are ""one of the most pressing chemical challenges of our time,"" Environment Minister Emma Hardy said as she launched the plan. ""It's crucial that we protect both public health and the environment for future generations. Through our PFAS Plan, we will act decisively to reduce their harmful effects while transitioning to safer alternatives,"" she said. The plan centres around three key aims: The number of water samples tested for PFAS will be increased by 50% across Scotland and Wales, whilst animals in coastal areas of England and soils in five priority areas will be tested to identify hotspots. PFAS are now ubiquitous in our everyday lives, used for example in school uniforms, medication casings and hydrogen production. Their incredibly strong chemical bonds give them properties which industries find very useful, such as being water-and oil-resistant, and they are also cheap to manufacture. But Dr Liz Chadwick, senior lecturer in biosciences at Cardiff University, said the chemicals leak out into the environment from manufacturing, washing our clothes or products with PFAS, as well as from the spread of waste sludge from water treatment works onto agricultural fields. ""PFAS are very persistent in the environment, they are also bioaccumulative and they are also known to be toxic, those three things together gives our rise for concern about chemicals in the environment,"" said Other household products they can be found in include cosmetics, baking equipment and frying pans, dishwasher rinse aid and polish. As well as more testing, the government also wants to raise public awareness by launching a website dedicated to information on the chemicals. The plan has been broadly welcomed by environmental charities and scientists but there is disagreement about whether further research is needed before restrictions are put in place. ""More research, more monitoring is important, but that should not come before regulating them at the source. We should not be waiting for people to start showing adverse impacts before we take action,"" said Dr Shubhi Sharma, scientific researcher at environmental charity Chem Trust. She said the government should take a ""precautionary principle"" approach, where the use of a chemical is stopped if the potential harm could outweigh the benefits - considering the emerging risks of some PFAS. Earlier this year the World Health Organization raised significant concerns, about two specific PFAS. It classified PFOA as carcinogenic, and PFOS as possibly carcinogenic - increasing the risk of thyroid, testicular and kidney cancers. Both substances are already banned in the UK. Dr Hannah Moody, Director of Research and Engagement at Breast Cancer UK, said the government plan was a step forward, but ""the work is not complete on this, and we will continue to lobby for tighter and more stringent regulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals that are linked to possibly increasing breast cancer risk for the entire UK population."" Although the new plan does not include a commitment to banning PFAS, the government has said the UK will ""more closely align"" by December 2028 with EU regulations. The EU is proposing a universal ban on the chemicals unless they are proven essential for society. Closer alignment could speed up future regulation of PFAS, said Stephanie Metzger, policy adviser at the Royal Society of Chemistry. ""Our regulators after Brexit have been overwhelmed and busy with adapting to the changes that Brexit has caused, and so it means that doing this sort of in-depth work has often been pushed back. And so I think this is a really positive step,"" she said. Some manufacturers have already gone PFAS-free. But doing so is expensive, said Debbie Reed at Equip Outdoor Technologies, which owns outdoor brands Rab and Lowe Alpine. ""It's challenging as our supply chains are complex, in an insulating jacket there are 120 components. To make sure the products are PFAS-free we have to make sure the entire production line is cleaned,"" she said. This was a position echoed by Jun Kamei, CEO of Amphico, a company developing toxic-free textiles. ""PFAS [are] a very functional, versatile chemistry so replacing them is a lot of hard work from a technical perspective,"" he told the BBC at a Mills Fabrica exhibit for PFAS-free designers. ""It has taken us 7 years - but a hard problem worth tackling."" Instead of relying on voluntary phase-out, the water industry thinks the government should go much further and ban the chemicals completely. Currently water companies have to regularly test for the 48 most concerning PFAS and where levels are elevated, treat the water supply. This is a costly endeavour and something the industry says it should not be responsible for. ""While this is a useful first step, the government needs to go much further. The problem with PFAS will only get worse until chemical companies are forced to stop their manufacture and sale and clean up the mess they've already created,"" said a spokesperson for industry body Water UK. But the Chemical Industries Association pushed back and said that while it was working to find alternatives to PFAS, this is not a quick process. ""Finding suitable and viable alternatives that are environmentally better and provide the needed performance is a challenging task, often needing innovators to return to the drawing board in search of a potential replacement,"" said the trade body's spokesperson.
